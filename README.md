## What's this?

This is a version-controlled, open source store for a variety of texts I ended up having to write. Each document is in its separate directory, along with any associated assets, such as images.

Here is a list of the documents in this repository:

- [**Gating: a short note**](gating/about.md).
- [**Data processing pipelines: a short introduction**](dpps/about.md).
- [**Why Julia: A proposal for using Julia for NSM's SPOTLIGHT**](whyjulia/about.md).

# Introduction

> In short, because we are greedy[^1].

[^1]: From the post announcing the [**Julia**][julia] programming language to the world on the 14th of February, 2012, [**here**](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/) (accessed on the 8th of June, 2023).

## What's this?

This is a proposal. This is a story. This is a rant. This is me trying to convince anyone who will listen that we should be using [**Julia**][julia] to develop software for astronomical applications, *especially* the data processing pipelines for all the upcoming big projects and telescopes (like the [**S**quare **K**ilometer **A**rray (**SKA**)][ska], the would-be largest radio telescope in the world). I first conceived the idea of writing something like this last year, when I finally became convinced that my thoughts actually made sense, and were maybe worthy of being written down to paper (or a PDF, which is the next best thing). In the end, this is my scream into the void, my message in the bottle; if my fellow astronomers can hear me, I hope they scream back.

![The official logo for **Julia**. Released on 14 February 2012, work on it started back in 2009, when Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman banded together to create a high-level, dynamic language that could be as fast as C, C++ or Fortran.](./assets/img/julia-logo-color.svg)

This document lives on [**Github**][src]. If you think I have missed something, or gotten something wrong, or maybe you saw a typo in passing, feel free to open an issue [**here**][issues], or make a pull request! If you want to talk to me about any of this, feel free to send an [**email**][email], or hit me up on [**Twitter**][twitter].

## Who's this for?

My fellow astronomers, especially those who are working in the same field, and/or are routinely developing software for astronomical applications. To that end, I do assume some basic knowledge of astronomy, programming, and software development. However, I take care not to assume too much. Wherever necessary, I will take my time to explain certain concepts. Since this is directed to astronomers across the board, I will also spend some time introducing the field I work in. Feel free to skip parts of this document you have already familiar with. In the end, however, this is for me; it is a way to record my thoughts into something that is coherent and readable.

## Who am I?

Oh, I forgot to introduce myself! I am [**Ujjwal Panda**][me], working towards a Ph.D. at the [**N**ational **C**entre of **R**adio **A**strophysics (**NCRA**)][ncra]. My work focuses primarily on searching and studying **pulsars** and **F**ast **R**adio **B**ursts (**FRBs**) in the radio. I am a part of the [**N**ational **S**upercomputing **M**ission (**NSM**)][nsm]'s [**S**urvey for s**P**oradic radi**O** burs**T**s, via a commensa**L**, mult**I**beam, **G**PU-powered, **H**PC at the GMR**T** (**SPOTLIGHT**)][spotlight]; as the name indicates, it is a commensal survey for pulsars and FRBs via the [**G**iant **M**etrewave **R**adio **T**elescope (**GMRT**)][gmrt], with a dedicated high-performance, GPU-powered, cluster serving as the backend.

![The **GMRT**. It is an interferometer, consisting of 30 dishes, each 45 meters in diameter. There are 12 dishes in the central square, while the other 18 dishes are distributed into three *arms*, along the East, West, and South. The telescope is known for its wide frequency coverage, its imaging capabilities, and its state-of-the-art sensitivity, especially at lower frequencies.

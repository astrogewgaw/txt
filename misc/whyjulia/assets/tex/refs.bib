  abstract = {The detection of non-repeating or irregular events in time-domain radio astronomy has gained importance over the last decade due to the discovery of fast radio bursts. Existing or upcoming radio telescopes are gathering more and more data, and consequently, the software, which is an important part of these telescopes, must process large data volumes at high data rates. Data has to be searched through to detect new and interesting events, often in real time. These requirements necessitate new and fast algorithms that must process data quickly and accurately. In this work, we present new algorithms for single-pulse detection using boxcar filters. We have quantified the signal loss introduced by single-pulse-detection algorithms, which use boxcar filters, and based on these results, we have designed two distinct "lossy" algorithms. Our lossy algorithms use an incomplete set of boxcar filters to accelerate detection at the expense of a small reduction in detected signal power. We present formulae for signal loss, descriptions of our algorithms and their parallel implementation on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. We also present tests of correctness, tests on artificial data, and the performance achieved. Our implementation can process SKA-MID-like data 266\texttimes{} faster than real time on an NVIDIA P100 GPU and 500\texttimes{} faster than real time on an NVIDIA Titan V GPU with a mean signal power loss of 7\%. We conclude with prospects for single-pulse detection for beyond the SKA era, nanosecond time-resolution radio astronomy.},

  abstract = {Recent observations have shown that repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) exhibit band-limited emission, whose frequency-dependent amplitude can be modeled using a Gaussian function. In this analysis, we show that banded emission of FRBs can lead to incompleteness across the observing band. This biases the detected sample of bursts and can explain the various shapes of cumulative energy distributions seen for repeating FRBs. We assume a Gaussian shape of the burst spectra and used simulations to demonstrate the above bias using an FRB 121102-like example. We recovered energy distributions that showed a break in power-law and flattening of power-law at low energies, based on the fluence threshold of the observations. We provide recommendations for single-pulse searches and analysis of repeating FRBs to account for this incompleteness. Primarily, we recommend that burst spectra should be modeled to estimate the intrinsic fluence and bandwidth of the burst robustly. Also, bursts that lie mainly within the observing band should be used for analyses of energy distributions. We show that the bimodality reported in the distribution of energies of FRB 121102 by Li et al. (2021) disappears when burst bandwidth, instead of the center frequency of the observation, is used to estimate energy. Sub-banded searches will also aid in detecting band-limited bursts. All the analysis scripts used in this work are available in a Github repository.},

  abstract = {Observationally, fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be divided into repeating and apparently nonrepeating (one-off) ones. It is unclear whether all FRBs repeat and whether there are genuine nonrepeating FRBs. We attempt to address these questions using Monte Carlo simulations. We define a parameter Tc at which the accumulated number of nonrepeating sources becomes comparable to the total number of repeating sources, which is a good proxy to denote the intrinsic repeater fraction among FRBs. Assuming that both types of sources exist and their burst energies follow power-law distributions, we investigate how the observed repeater fraction evolves with time for different parameters. If the lifetime of repeaters is sufficiently long that the evolutionary effect can be neglected within the observational time span, unless Tc \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$} (i.e., there is no genuine nonrepeating FRB source), the observed repeater fraction should increase with time first, reach a peak, and then decline. The peak time Tp and peak fraction Fr,obs,p depend on Tc and other repeating rate parameters. With the current data, we pose a lower limit Tc {$>$} 0.1 day for reasonable parameter values. We predict that future continuous monitoring of FRBs with CHIME or similar wide-field radio telescopes would obtain an Fr,obs less than 0.04. The detection of a smaller peak value Fr,obs,p {$<$} 0.04 in the near future would disfavor the ansatz that ``all FRB sources repeat.''},

  abstract = {Sufficiently low magnetic field neutron stars which accrete for long times from a surrounding keplerian disk can be spun up to millisecond periods. After accretion ceases, such stars could become isolated or binary pulsars, depending on whether their companions have subsequently disrupted the binary by either their tidal break ups or their supernova explosions. Such pulsars constitute a new class, with short periods, long apparent ages (P/\.P {$\greaterequivlnt$} 108 yr) and pulsed optical, X-ray and {$\gamma$}-ray fluxes significantly below those expected for canonical pulsars with similar periods. Because of their long subsequent spin-down lifetimes, such pulsars would probably be observable if their birth rate exceeded even 10-4 that of the canonical ones. We propose here that the recently discovered millisecond pulsar 4C21.53 belongs to this new class, together with the binaries PSRs 1913+16, 0820+02 and 0655+64, as well as possibly several isolated pulsars such as PSRs 1952+29 and 1804-08. The possibility of such a class of fast accretion-spun-up pulsars has also been noted by Backus et al.1.},

The catalog represents the first large sample, including bursts from repeaters and nonrepeaters, observed in a single survey with uniform selection effects. This facilitates comparative and absolute studies of the FRB population. We show that repeaters and apparent nonrepeaters have sky locations and dispersion measures (DMs) that are consistent with being drawn from the same distribution. However, bursts from repeating sources differ from apparent nonrepeaters in intrinsic temporal width and spectral bandwidth. Through injection of simulated events into our detection pipeline, we perform an absolute calibration of selection effects to account for systematic biases. We find evidence for a population of FRBs\textemdash composing a large fraction of the overall population\textemdash with a scattering time at 600 MHz in excess of 10 ms, of which only a small fraction are observed by CHIME/FRB.

These repeat bursts are consistent with its origin from a single position on the sky, with the same dispersion measure, about 189 parsecs per cubic centimetre. This line of sight traces approximately twice the expected Milky Way column density of free electrons, which implies an upper limit on the source redshift of 0.1, showing it to be closer to Earth by a factor of at least 2 than FRB~1211028. In some of the repeat bursts, we observe subpulse frequency structure, drifting and spectral variation reminiscent of that seen in FRB~1211029,10, suggesting similar emission mechanisms or propagation effects.

  abstract = {While binary pulsar systems are fantastic laboratories for a wide array of astrophysics, they are particularly difficult to detect. The orbital motion of the pulsar changes its apparent spin frequency over the course of an observation, essentially ``smearing'' the response of the time series in the Fourier domain. We review the Fourier domain acceleration search (FDAS), which uses a matched filtering algorithm to correct for this smearing by assuming constant acceleration for a small enough portion of the orbit. We discuss the theory and implementation of a Fourier domain ``jerk'' search, developed as part of the PRESTO software package, which extends the FDAS to account for a linearly changing acceleration, or constant orbital jerk, of the pulsar. We test the performance of our algorithm on archival Green Bank Telescope observations of the globular cluster Terzan 5, and show that while the jerk search has a significantly longer runtime, it improves search sensitivity to binaries when the observation duration is 5\%-15\% of the orbital period. Finally, we present the jerk-search-enabled detection of Ter5am (PSR J1748-2446am), a new highly accelerated pulsar in a compact, eccentric, and relativistic orbit, with a likely pulsar mass of \{1.649\}-0.11+0.037 M {$\odot$}.},

The long (roughly 3\,s) duration and nine or more components forming the pulse profile make this source an outlier in the FRB population. Such short periodicity provides strong evidence for a neutron-star origin of the event. Moreover, our detection favours emission arising from the neutron-star magnetosphere3,4, as opposed to emission regions located further away from the star, as predicted by some models5.},

We have observed the actively repeating FRB 20190520B over a span of fourteen months and found that its Faraday rotation measure is both large in magnitude and rapidly varying, including two sign changes which indicate time-dependent orientation changes of the magnetic field along our line of sight. The FRB also depolarizes rapidly at lower frequencies. These phenomena can be explained in terms of multi-path propagation through a highly turbulent, dense magnetized screen within a range of 8 AU to 100 pc away from the FRB source, distinctly narrowing the possible physical configurations that could give rise to the emission seen in FRB 20190520B.},

  abstract = {We searched for an isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background in the second data release of the International Pulsar Timing Array, a global collaboration synthesizing decadal-length pulsar-timing campaigns in North America, Europe, and Australia. In our reference search for a power-law strain spectrum of the form \$h\_c = A(f/1\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{yr\}\^\{-1\})\^\{\textbackslash alpha \}\$, we found strong evidence for a spectrally similar low-frequency stochastic process of amplitude \$A = 3.8\^\{+6.3\}\_\{-2.5\}\textbackslash times 10\^\{-15\}\$ and spectral index {$\alpha~$}= -0.5~{$\pm~$}0.5, where the uncertainties represent 95~per\,cent credible regions, using information from the auto- and cross-correlation terms between the pulsars in the array. For a spectral index of {$\alpha~$}= -2/3, as expected from a population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries, the recovered amplitude is \$A = 2.8\^\{+1.2\}\_\{-0.8\}\textbackslash times 10\^\{-15\}\$. None the less, no significant evidence of the Hellings\textendash Downs correlations that would indicate a gravitational-wave origin was found. We also analysed the constituent data from the individual pulsar timing arrays in a consistent way, and clearly demonstrate that the combined international data set is more sensitive. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this combined data set produces comparable constraints to recent single-array data sets which have more data than the constituent parts of the combination. Future international data releases will deliver increased sensitivity to gravitational wave radiation, and significantly increase the detection probability.},

  abstract = {Astrophysical radio transients are excellent probes of extreme physical processes originating from compact sources within our Galaxy and beyond. Radio frequency signals emitted from these objects provide a means to study the intervening medium through which they travel. Next generation radio telescopes are designed to explore the vast unexplored parameter space of high time resolution astronomy, but require High Performance Computing (HPC) solutions to process the enormous volumes of data that are produced by these telescopes. We have developed a combined software/hardware solution (code named ARTEMIS) for real-time searches for millisecond radio transients, which uses GPU technology to remove interstellar dispersion and detect millisecond radio bursts from astronomical sources in real-time. Here we present an introduction to ARTEMIS. We give a brief overview of the software pipeline, then focus specifically on the intricacies of performing incoherent de-dispersion. We present results from two brute-force algorithms. The first is a GPU based algorithm, designed to exploit the L1 cache of the NVIDIA Fermi GPU. Our second algorithm is CPU based and exploits the new AVX units in Intel Sandy Bridge CPUs.},

  abstract = {The search for astronomical pulsed signals within noisy data in the radio band is usually performed through an initial Fourier analysis to find ``candidate'' frequencies and then refined through the folding of the time series using trial frequencies close to the candidate. In order to establish the significance of the pulsed profiles found at these trial frequencies, pulsed profiles are evaluated with a {$\chi$} 2 test to establish how much they depart from a null hypothesis where the signal is consistent with a flat distribution of noisy measurements. In high-energy astronomy, the {$\chi$} 2 statistic has widely been replaced by the statistic and H-test, as they are more sensitive to extra information, such as the harmonic content of the pulsed profile. The statistic and H-test were originally developed for use with ``event data'' composed of arrival times of single photons, leaving it unclear how these methods could be used in radio astronomy. In this paper, we present a version of the statistic and H-test for pulse profiles with Gaussian uncertainties appropriate for radio or even optical pulse profiles. We show how these statistical indicators provide better sensitivity to low-significance pulsar candidates with respect to the usual {$\chi$} 2 method and a straightforward way to discriminate between pulse profile shapes. Moreover, they provide an additional tool for radio frequency interference rejection.},

IPS modulation is rare at low latitudes because of interstellar angular broadening. Second, the source has an extremely steep (\textasciitilde v-2) spectrum at decametric wavelengths2. This combination of properties suggested that 4C21.53 was either an undetected pulsar or a member of some new class of objects. This puzzle may be resolved by the discovery and related observations of a fast pulsar, 1937+214, with a period of 1.558 ms in the constellation Vulpecula only a few degrees from the direction to the original pulsar, 1919+21. The existence of such a fast pulsar with no evidence either of a new formation event or of present energy losses raises new questions about the origin and evolution of pulsars.},

  abstract = {DURING an investigation of the short-term behaviour of the radiation coming from pulsars during strong bursts, several objects were found to exhibit pulse nulling phenomena. This was first noted on analogue records of the pulsar radiation intensity where the pen deflexions are a rough measure of the pulse energy. PSR's 0834 + 06, 1133 + 16, 1237 + 25 and 1929 + 10 were found suddenly to miss from one to ten pulses at various times, termed ``nulls'', during otherwise very strong and steady bursts. A null means that the pulse energy decreased by a factor of ten or more over one or two pulse periods and then increased just as sharply after the null. The nulls can be divided into two types according to their duration and their spacing. Type I nulls are the most prominent with a width between three and ten pulses and recur with spacings of about fifty pulses. Type II nulls have a width of only one or two pulses and recur with spacings of three to ten pulses. Pulse sequences from 1133 + 16 and 1237 + 25 and possibly 0834 + 06 contain the Type I nulls while sequences from all four objects contain Type II nulls. A quick look at the spacings of these nulls suggests that they may recur periodically and hence contribute to responses at characteristic periods in pulse energy fluctuation power spectra. This possibility has been reported indirectly by Sutton et al.1 and Hesse2 for the Type II nulls in 0834 + 06 and directly by Lang3 for Type I nulls in 1133 + 16 and 1237 + 25.},

Thousands of potentially observable FRBs reach Earth every day, which likely originate from highly magnetic and/or rapidly rotating neutron stars in the distant Universe. Some FRBs repeat, with this subclass often occurring in highly magnetic environments. Two repeating FRBs exhibit cyclic activity windows, consistent with an orbital period. One nearby FRB was emitted by a Galactic magnetar during an x-ray outburst. The host galaxies of some FRBs have been located, providing information about the host environments and the total baryonic content of the Universe.}

The codebase has been re-written in Python (save for some external libraries, which remain in their native Fortran), utilizing the object-oriented features of the language, and improving the modularity of the code. Pre-written scripts are provided for running the simulations in `standard' modes of operation, but the code is flexible enough to support the writing of personalised scripts. The modular structure also makes the addition of experimental features (such as new models for period or luminosity distributions) more straightforward than with the previous code. We also discuss potential additions to the modelling capabilities of the software. Finally, we demonstrate some potential applications of the code; first, using results of surveys at different observing frequencies, we find pulsar spectral indices are best fitted by a normal distribution with mean -1.4 and standard deviation 1.0. Secondly, we model pulsar spin evolution to calculate the best fit for a relationship between a pulsar's luminosity and spin parameters. We used the code to replicate the analysis of Faucher-Gigu\`ere \&amp; Kaspi, and have subsequently optimized their power-law dependence of radio luminosity, L, with period, P, and period derivative, \.P. We find that the underlying population is best described by L {$\propto$} P-1.39{$\pm$}0.09\.P0.48{$\pm$}0.04 and is very similar to that found for {$\gamma$}-ray pulsars by Perera et~al. Using this relationship, we generate a model population and examine the age\textendash luminosity relation for the entire pulsar population, which may be measurable after future large-scale surveys with the Square Kilometre Array.},

We combine these with 13 other well-localized FRBs in the literature, and analyze the host galaxy properties. We find no significant differences in the host properties of repeating and apparently nonrepeating FRBs. FRB hosts are moderately star forming, with masses slightly offset from the star-forming main sequence. Star formation and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region emission are major sources of ionization in FRB host galaxies, with the former dominant in repeating FRB hosts. FRB hosts do not track stellar mass and star formation as seen in field galaxies (more than 95\% confidence). FRBs are rare in massive red galaxies, suggesting that progenitor formation channels are not solely dominated by delayed channels which lag star formation by gigayears. The global properties of FRB hosts are indistinguishable from core-collapse supernovae and short gamma-ray bursts hosts, and the spatial offset (from galaxy centers) of FRBs is mostly inconsistent with that of the Galactic neutron star population (95\% confidence). The spatial offsets of FRBs (normalized to the galaxy effective radius) also differ from those of globular clusters in late- and early-type galaxies with 95\% confidence.},

  abstract = {We are conducting a survey for pulsars and transients using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). The GMRT High Resolution Southern Sky (GHRSS) survey is an off-Galactic-plane (|b|{$>$}5) survey in the declination range -40 deg to -54 deg at 322 MHz. With the high time (up to 30.72 micro-sec) and frequency (up to 0.016275 MHz) resolution observing modes, the 5-sigma detection limit is 0.5 mJy for a 2 ms pulsar with 10\% duty cycle at 322 MHz. Total GHRSS sky coverage of 2866 square-deg, will result from 1953 pointing, each covering 1.8 square-deg. The 10-sigma detection limit for a 5 milli-sec transient burst is 1.6 Jy for the GHRSS survey. In addition, the GHRSS survey can reveal transient events like rotating radio transients or fast radio bursts. With 35\% of the survey completed (i.e. 1000 square-deg), we report the discovery of 10 pulsars, one of which is a millisecond pulsar (MSP), one of the highest pulsar per square degree discovery rates for any off-Galactic plane survey. We re-detected 23 known in-beam pulsars. Utilising the imaging capability of the GMRT we also localised 4 of the GHRSS pulsars (including the MSP) in the gated image plane within +/- 10 arc-second. We demonstrated rapid convergence in pulsar timing with a more precise position than is possible with single dish discoveries. We also exhibited that we can localise the brightest transient sources with simultaneously obtained lower time resolution imaging data, demonstrating a technique that may have application in the SKA.},

For PSR J1913+1330, we also observe a two orders of magnitude variation in the observed pulse detection rates across individual epochs, which may constrain the models explaining the origin of RRAT pulses. PSR J1913+1330 is also observed to exhibit a weak persistent emission mode. We investigate the post-glitch timing properties of J1819-1458 (the only RRAT for which glitches are observed) and discuss the implications for possible glitch models. Its post-glitch over-recovery of the frequency derivative is magnetar-like and similar behaviour is only observed for two other pulsars, both of which have relatively high magnetic field strengths. Following the over-recovery we also observe that some fraction of the pre-glitch frequency derivative is gradually recovered.},

  abstract = {Unraveling the mystery of fast radio bursts (FRBs) - extremely high-energy events occurring outside the Milky Way that last fractions of a second - is a hot topic topic in radio astronomy. Detecting new FRBs is increasingly complicated by RFI as the radio bandwidth becomes more congested and radio telescopes become more sensitive. In this paper we propose, implement and validate a novel RFI-mitigation algorithm designed for FRB detection called edge-thresholding.Modern radio telescopes produce an immense amount of data that needs to be processed in real-time. This requirement invalidates many RFI-mitigation algorithms based upon techniques such as kurtosis, surface-fitting or Fourier transforms due to their computational complexity. This had led to the development of thresholding methods which are computational simple, well suited to GPU acceleration and provide accurate RFI mitigation.In this paper we propose edge-thresholding, the first thresholding based RFI-mitigation algorithm specifically designed for FRB detection. Edge-thresholding works by flagging data within a window if the points minimum difference to a boundary point is above a computed threshold. Linear time-complexity means it scales to the increasing data rates of radio telescopes.Edge-thresholding takes advantage of two features that FRBs exhibit but RFI does not. First, FRBs are generally wider than deleterious RFI and second FRBs have a pseudo Gaussian profile due to the finite frequency resolution of the telescope causing DM smearing.We combine edge-thresholding with a time-domain sigma cut in a unified pipeline. A GPU accelerated implementation of this pipeline is shown to run in the real-time on WSRT data. Additionally, less than 36.86 additional kilobytes of memory are required for 804 megabytes of input data.Using data from WSRT containing simulated FRBs we shown that our pipeline reduces false-positives and increases the number of detected FRBs. These results are further validated by experiments using data from the Crab-Pulsar. These results show that our pipeline could outperform AO-Flagger, the RFI-mitigation pipeline used for WSRT and LOFAR.},

The extragalactic interpretation was based on the swept-frequency nature of the event, which followed the dispersive delay expected from an extragalactic pulse. We report here on the detection of 16 pulses, the bulk of which exhibit a frequency sweep with a shape and magnitude resembling the Lorimer Burst. These new events were detected in a sidelobe of the Parkes Telescope and are of clearly terrestrial origin, with properties unlike any known sources of terrestrial broadband radio emission. The new detections cast doubt on the extragalactic interpretation of the original burst, and call for further sophistication in radio-pulse survey techniques to identify the origin of the anomalous terrestrial signals and definitively distinguish future extragalactic pulse detections from local signals. The ambiguous origin of these seemingly dispersed, swept-frequency signals suggests that radio-pulse searches using multiple detectors will be the only experiments able to provide definitive information about the origin of new swept-frequency radio burst detections.},

We assume a power-law model for the intrinsic energy distribution for each repeating FRB source located at a randomly chosen position in the sky and simulate their dispersion measures and propagation effects along the chosen lines-of-sight to various telescopes. In one scenario, an exponential distribution for the intrinsic wait times between pulses is chosen, and in a second scenario we model the observed pulse arrival times to follow a Weibull distribution. For both models we determine whether the FRB source would be deemed a repeater based on the telescope sensitivity and time spent on follow-up observations. We are unable to rule out the existence of a single FRB population based on comparisons of our simulations with the longest FRB follow-up observations performed. We however rule out the possibility of FRBs~171020 and 010724 repeating with the same rate statistics as FRB~121102 and also constrain the slope of a power-law fit to the FRB energy distribution to be -2.0~\&lt;~{$\gamma~\&$}lt;~-1.0. All-sky simulations of repeating FRB sources imply that the detection of singular events correspond to the bright tail end of the adopted energy distribution due to the combination of the increase in volume probed with distance, and the position of the burst in the telescope beam.},

With a spin period of 75.88\,s, a characteristic age of 5.3\,Myr and a narrow pulse duty cycle, it is uncertain how its radio emission is generated and challenges our current understanding of how these systems evolve. The radio emission has unique spectro-temporal properties, such as quasi-periodicity and partial nulling, that provide important clues to the emission mechanism. Detecting similar sources is observationally challenging, which implies a larger undetected population. Our discovery establishes the existence of ultra-long-period neutron stars, suggesting a possible connection to the evolution of highly magnetized neutron stars, ultra-long-period magnetars and fast radio bursts.},

Fortuitously, the Nan\c{c}ay radio telescope observations on this day overlapped with the last hour of MeerKAT observations and resulted in four simultaneous detections. The observations with MeerKAT's wide band receiver, which extends down to relatively low frequencies (900\textendash 1670\,MHz usable L-band range), have allowed us to get a detailed look at the complex frequency structure, intensity variations, and frequency-dependent sub-pulse drifting. The drift rates we measure for the full-band and sub-banded data are consistent with those published between 600~and~6500\,MHz with a slope of -0.147~{$\pm~$}0.014\,ms-1. Two of the detected bursts exhibit fainter `precursors' separated from the brighter main pulse by {$\sim$}28 and {$\sim$}34\,ms. A follow-up multi-telescope campaign on the 6th and 8th of 2019 October to better understand these frequency drifts and structures over a wide and continuous band was undertaken.

Weaknesses in the Fast Fourier Transform, including a susceptibility to red noise, leave it insensitive to pulsars with long rotational periods (P {$>$} 1 s). This sensitivity gap has the potential to bias our understanding of the period distribution of the pulsar population. The Fast Folding Algorithm, a time-domain based pulsar searching technique, has the potential to overcome some of these biases. Modern distributed-computing frameworks now allow for the application of this algorithm to all-sky blind pulsar surveys for the first time. However, many aspects of the behaviour of this search technique remain poorly understood, including its responsiveness to variations in pulse shape and the presence of red noise. Using a custom CPU-based implementation of the Fast Folding Algorithm, ffancy, we have conducted an in-depth study into the behaviour of the Fast Folding Algorithm in both an ideal, white noise regime as well as a trial on observational data from the HTRU-S Low Latitude pulsar survey, including a comparison to the behaviour of the Fast Fourier Transform. We are able to both confirm and expand upon earlier studies that demonstrate the ability of the Fast Folding Algorithm to outperform the Fast Fourier Transform under ideal white noise conditions, and demonstrate a significant improvement in sensitivity to long-period pulsars in real observational data through the use of the Fast Folding Algorithm.},

Many of the proposed models to explain FRBs use a single high-energy event involving compact objects (such as neutron-star mergers) and therefore cannot easily explain a two-component FRB. Models that are based on extreme versions of flaring, pulsing, or orbital events, however, could produce multiple component profiles. The compatibility of these models and the FRB rate implied by these detections is discussed.},

Emission in multiple bursts is visible down to the bottom of the GBT band, suggesting that the cutoff frequency (if it exists) for FRB emission is lower than 300 MHz. Observations were conducted during predicted periods of activity of the source, and had simultaneous coverage with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the FRB backend on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. We find that one of the GBT-detected bursts has potentially associated emission in the CHIME band (400-800 MHz) but we detect no bursts in the LOFAR band (110-190 MHz), placing a limit of \$\textbackslash alpha {$>$} -1.0\$ on the spectral index of broadband emission from the source. We also find that emission from the source is severely band-limited with burst bandwidths as low as \$\textbackslash sim\$40 MHz. In addition, we place the strictest constraint on observable scattering of the source, \${$<\$$} 1.7 ms, at 350 MHz, suggesting that the circumburst environment does not have strong scattering properties. Additionally, knowing that the circumburst environment is optically thin to free-free absorption at 300 MHz, we find evidence against the association of a hyper-compact HII region or a young supernova remnant (age \${$<\$$} 50 yr) with the source.},

In its new form, the power of its application to String-Length period searches (SLLK) has been assessed in terms of establishing confidence levels to point value detections within any generated periodogram and to confidence levels of not missing the detection when an underlying period is present. These estimations depend only on the amplitude of the variation relative to the measurement noise and are independent of the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements and of their number. Examples of the behaviour of periodograms based on SLLK as produced from computer generated data and real data are discussed. It is also demonstrated that the principle can be readily extended to multivariate data in the form of Rope-Length period searches (RLLK), with the measurements of each parameter not necessarily being taken simultaneously nor with equal number. Using simulated data it is shown that the power of period detection improves slightly if the underlying modulations in each parameter are out of phase with each other. Examples of the RLLK principle are given for computer simulated data and for stellar multi-colour photometric and polarimetric measurements.},

The time of arrival data are fit to a physical timing model for each source, including terms that characterize time-variable dispersion measure and frequency-dependent pulse shape evolution. In conjunction with the timing model fit, we have performed a Bayesian analysis of a parameterized timing noise model for each source, and detect evidence for excess low-frequency, or ``red,'' timing noise in 10 of the pulsars. For 5 of these cases this is likely due to interstellar medium propagation effects rather than intrisic spin variations. Subsequent papers in this series will present further analysis of this data set aimed at detecting or limiting the presence of nanohertz-frequency gravitational wave signals.},

Some FRB sources emit repeat bursts, ruling out cataclysmic origins for those events. Despite searches for periodicity in repeat burst arrival times on time scales from milliseconds to many days, these bursts have hitherto been observed to appear sporadically, and though clustered, without a regular pattern. Here we report the detection of a \$16.35\textbackslash pm0.15\$ day periodicity (or possibly a higher-frequency alias of that periodicity) from a repeating FRB 180916.J0158+65 detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB). In 38 bursts recorded from September 16th, 2018 through February 4th, 2020, we find that all bursts arrive in a 5-day phase window, and 50\% of the bursts arrive in a 0.6-day phase window. Our results suggest a mechanism for periodic modulation either of the burst emission itself, or through external amplification or absorption, and disfavour models invoking purely sporadic processes.},

It (a) describes the distribution of the free electrons responsible for pulsar dispersion measures and thus can be used for estimating the distances to pulsars; (b) describes large-scale variations in the strength of fluctuations in electron density that underly interstellar scattering; (c) can be used to interpret interstellar scattering and scintillation observations of Galactic objects and of extragalactic objects, such as intrinsically compact AGNs and Gamma-ray burst afterglows; and (d) serves as a preliminary, smooth spatial model of the warm ionized component of the interstellar gas. This work builds upon and supercedes the Taylor \& Cordes (1993) model by exploiting new observations and analysis methods. For lines of sight directed out of the Galactic plane, the new model yields substantially larger values for pulsar dispersion measures, except for directions dominated by the local hot bubble. Unlike the TC93 model, the new model provides sufficient electrons to account for the dispersion measures of the vast majority of known, Galactic pulsars. The new model is described and exemplified using plots of astronomically useful quantities on Galactic-coordinate grids. Software available on the Internet is also described. Future observations and analysis techniques that will improve the Galactic model are outlined.},

  abstract = {Detections from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 are clustered in time, noticeable even in the earliest repeat bursts. Recently, it was argued that the source activity is periodic, suggesting that the clustering reflected a not-yet-identified periodicity. We performed an extensive multiwavelength campaign with the Effelsberg telescope, the Green Bank telescope, and the Arecibo Observatory to shadow the Gran Telescope Canaria (optical), NuSTAR (X-ray) and INTEGRAL ({$\gamma$}-ray). We detected 36 bursts with Effelsberg, one with a pulse width of 39\,ms, the widest burst ever detected from FRB 121102. With one burst detected during simultaneous NuSTAR observations, we place a 5{$\sigma$} upper limit of 5~\texttimes ~1047 erg on the 3\textendash 79\,keV energy of an X-ray burst counterpart. We tested the periodicity hypothesis using 165\,h of Effelsberg observations and find a periodicity of 161~{$\pm~$}5~d. We predict the source to be active from 2020 July 9 to October 14 and subsequently from 2020 December 17 to 2021 March 24. We compare the wait times between consecutive bursts within a single observation to Weibull and Poisson distributions. We conclude that the strong clustering was indeed a consequence of a periodic activity and show that if the few events with millisecond separation are excluded, the arrival times are Poisson distributed. We model the bursts' cumulative energy distribution with energies from {$\sim$}1038\textendash 1039 erg and find that it is well described by a power law with slope of {$\gamma~$}= -1.1~{$\pm~$}0.2. We propose that a single power law might be a poor descriptor of the data over many orders of magnitude.},

Images of the variance of radio signals in both time and frequency can be used to detect pulsars in large-scale continuum surveys using the next generation of synthesis radio telescopes. This technique allows a search over the full field of view while avoiding the need for expensive pixel-by-pixel high time resolution searches. We investigate the sensitivity of detecting pulsars in variance images. We show that variance images are most sensitive to pulsars whose scintillation time-scales and bandwidths are close to the subintegration time and channel bandwidth. Therefore, in order to maximise the detection of pulsars for a given radio continuum survey, it is essential to retain a high time and frequency resolution, allowing us to make variance images sensitive to pulsars with different scintillation properties. We demonstrate the technique with Murchision Widefield Array data and show that variance images can indeed lead to the detection of pulsars by distinguishing them from other radio sources.},

The recently localized FRB 20190520B is extremely active, has the largest confirmed host dispersion measure, and is only the second FRB source associated with a compact, persistent radio source (PRS). The main tracer of the magneto-ionic environments is the rotation measure (RM), a path-integral of the line-of-sight component of magnetic field strength (B) and electron density, which does not allow a direct probe of the B-field configuration. Here we report direct evidence for a B-field reversal based on the observed sign change and extreme variation of FRB 20190520B's RM, which changed from \$\textbackslash sim10000\$ rad m\$\^\{-2\}\$ to \$\textbackslash sim-16000\$ rad m\$\^\{-2\}\$ between June 2021 and January 2022. Such extreme RM reversal has never been observed before in any FRB nor in any astronomical object. The implied short-term change of the B-field configuration in or around the FRB could be due to the vicinity of massive black holes, or a magnetized companion star in binary systems, or a young supernova remnant along the line of sight.},

  abstract = {Given the possible repetitive nature of fast radio bursts (FRBs), their cosmological origin, and their high occurrence, detection of strongly lensed sources due to intervening galaxy lenses is possible with forthcoming radio surveys. We show that if multiple images of a repeating source are resolved with VLBI, using a method independent of lens modeling, accurate timing could reveal non-uniform motion, either physical or apparent, of the emission spot. This can probe the physical nature of FRBs and their surrounding environments, constraining scenarios including orbital motion around a stellar companion if FRBs require a compact star in a special system, and jet-medium interactions for which the location of the emission spot may randomly vary. The high timing precision possible for FRBs (\$\textbackslash sim \{\textbackslash rm ms\}\$) compared to the typical time delays between images in galaxy lensing (\$\textbackslash gtrsim 10\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm days\}\$) enables the measurement of tiny fractional changes in the delays (\$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-9\}\$), and hence the detection of time-delay variations induced by relative motions between the source, the lens, and the Earth. We show that uniform cosmic peculiar velocities only cause the delay time to drift linearly, and that the effect from the Earth's orbital motion can be accurately subtracted, thus enabling a search for non-trivial source motion. For a timing accuracy of \$\textbackslash sim 1\textbackslash,\$ms and a repetition rate (of detected bursts) \$\textbackslash sim 0.05\$ per day of a single FRB source, non-uniform displacement \$\textbackslash gtrsim 0.1 - 1\textbackslash,\$AU of the emission spot perpendicular to the line of sight is detectable if repetitions are seen over a period of hundreds of days.},

In this paper, the previously developed techniques for the estimation of red power spectra are extended, with the discussion of several topics relevant to a practical scheme for the recovery of red noise spectra. Among the power estimators investigated, the best performance is provided by the lowest mode estimator and by a small-degree polynomial which closely approximates the lowest mode. A scheme for the recovery of red power spectra which relies on the use of a single species of estimator on a hierarchy of time scales is proposed.},

  abstract = {The study of binary pulsars enables tests of general relativity. Orbital motion in binary systems causes the apparent pulsar spin frequency to drift, reducing the sensitivity of periodicity searches. Acceleration searches are methods that account for the effect of orbital acceleration. Existing methods are currently computationally expensive, and the vast amount of data that will be produced by next-generation instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array necessitates real-time acceleration searches, which in turn requires the use of high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. We present our implementation of the correlation technique for the Fourier Domain Acceleration Search (FDAS) algorithm on Graphics Processor Units (GPUs). The correlation technique is applied as a convolution with multiple finite impulse response (FIR) filters in the Fourier domain. Two approaches are compared: the first uses the NVIDIA cuFFT library for applying Fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) on the GPU, and the second contains a custom FFT implementation in GPU shared memory. We find that the FFT shared-memory implementation performs between 1.5 and 3.2 times faster than our cuFFT-based application for smaller but sufficient filter sizes. It is also 4-6 times faster than the existing GPU and OpenMP implementations of FDAS. This work is part of the AstroAccelerate project, a many-core accelerated time-domain signal-processing library for radio astronomy.},

Using wide-band observations with two telescopes, we report polarization measurements of five repeating FRBs and find a trend of lower polarization at lower frequencies. This behavior is modeled as multipath scattering, characterized by a single parameter, {$\sigma$}RM, the rotation measure (RM) scatter. Sources with higher {$\sigma$}RM have higher RM magnitude and scattering time scales. The two sources with the highest {$\sigma$}RM, FRB~20121102A and FRB~20190520B, are associated with compact persistent radio sources.

The prototypical FRB is a broadband signal that occurs over the extent of the receiver frequency range, is narrow in time, and is highly dispersed, following a \$\textbackslash nu\^\{-2\}\$ relation. However, some FRBs appear band-limited, and show apparent scintillation, complex frequency-dependent structure, or multi-component pulse shapes. While there is sufficient evidence that FRBs are indeed astrophysical, their one-off nature necessitates extra scrutiny when reporting a detection as bona fide and not a false positive. Currently, there is no formal validation framework for FRBs, rather a set of community practices. In this article, we discuss potential sources of false positives, and suggest a framework in which FRB-like events can be evaluated as real or otherwise. We present examples of false-positive events in data from the Arecibo, LOFAR, and Nanshan telescopes, which while FRB-like, are found to be due to instrumental variations, noise, and radio-frequency interference. Differentiating these false-positive detections from astrophysical events requires knowledge and tests beyond thresholded single-pulse detection. We discuss post-detection analyses, verification tests, and datasets which should be provided when reporting an FRB detection.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we express the relativistic propagational delay of light in the space-time of a binary system (commonly known as the `Shapiro delay') as a sum of harmonics of the orbital period of the system. We do this first for near-circular orbits as a natural expansion of an existing orbital model for low-eccentricity binary systems. The amplitudes of the third and higher harmonics can be described by two new post-Keplerian (PK) parameters proportional to the amplitudes of the third and fourth harmonics (h3, h4). For high orbital inclinations we use a PK parameter proportional to the ratio of amplitudes of successive harmonics ({$\varsigma$}) instead of h4. The new PK parameters are much less correlated with each other than r and s, and provide a superior description of the constraints introduced by the Shapiro delay on the orbital inclination and the masses of the components of the binary. A least-squares fit that uses h3 always converges, unlike in the case of the (r, s) parametrization; its resulting statistical significance is the best indicator of whether the Shapiro delay has been detected. Until now these constraints could only be derived from Bayesian {$\chi$}2 maps of the (cosi, mc) space. We show that for low orbital inclinations even these maps overestimate the masses of the components and that this can be corrected by mapping the orthogonal (h3, h4) space instead. Finally, we extend the h3, {$\varsigma$} parametrization to eccentric binaries with high orbital inclinations. For some such binaries we can measure extra PK parameters and test general relativity using the Shapiro delay parameters. In this case we can use the measurement of h3 as a test of general relativity. We show that this new test is not only more stringent than the r test, but it is even more stringent than the previous s test. Until now this new parametric test could only be derived statistically from an analysis of a probabilistic {$\chi$}2 map.},

Broad features occur in {$\sim$}1 GHz wide subbands that typically differ in peak frequency between bursts within the band. Finer-scale structures ({$\sim$}10\textendash 50 MHz) within these bursts are consistent with the structure expected from Galactic diffractive interstellar scintillation.

  abstract = {Dedicated surveys using different detection pipelines are being carried out at multiple observatories to find more fast radio bursts (FRBs). Understanding the efficiency of detection algorithms and the survey completeness function is important to enable unbiased estimation of the underlying FRB population properties. One method to achieve end-to-end testing of the system is by injecting mock FRBs in the live data stream and searching for them blindly. Mock FRB injection is particularly effective for machine-learning-based classifiers, for which analytic characterization is impractical. We describe a first-of-its-kind implementation of a real-time mock FRB injection system at the upgraded Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (UTMOST) and present our results for a set of 20\,000 mock FRB injections. The injections have yielded clear insight into the detection efficiencies and have provided a survey completeness function for pulse width, fluence, and dispersion measure (DM). Mock FRBs are recovered with uniform efficiency over the full range of injected DMs; however, the recovery fraction is found to be a strong function of the width and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For low widths ({$\lessequivlnt$}20~ms) and high SNR ({$\greaterequivlnt$}9) the recovery is highly effective with recovery fractions exceeding 90~per~cent. We find that the presence of radio-frequency interference causes the recovered SNR values to be systematically lower by up to 20~per~cent compared to the injected values. We find that wider FRBs become increasingly hard to recover for the machine-learning-based classifier employed at UTMOST. We encourage other observatories to implement live injection set-ups for similar testing of their surveys.},

The analysis corrects problems with the earlier model of Epstein (1977), which prevented consistent fittings to binary pulsar timing data. Detection of post-Newtonian timing effects in PSR 1913 + 16 consistent with the relativistic two-point-mass model of the system provides powerful, independent evidence that the observed decrease of the pulsar's orbital period is due to the emission of gravitational radiation.},

  abstract = {FRB 121102 is the only known repeating fast radio burst source. Here we analyze a wide-frequency-range (1\textendash 8 GHz) sample of high signal-to-noise, coherently dedispersed bursts detected using the Arecibo and Green Bank telescopes. These bursts reveal complex time\textendash frequency structures that include subbursts with finite bandwidths. The frequency-dependent burst structure complicates the determination of a dispersion measure (DM); we argue that it is appropriate to use a DM metric that maximizes frequency-averaged pulse structure, as opposed to peak signal-to-noise, and find DM = 560.57 {$\pm$} 0.07 pc cm-3 at MJD 57,644. After correcting for dispersive delay, we find that the subbursts have characteristic frequencies that typically drift lower at later times in the total burst envelope. In the 1.1\textendash 1.7 GHz band, the {$\sim$}0.5\textendash 1 ms subbursts have typical bandwidths ranging from 100 to 400 MHz, and a characteristic drift rate of {$\sim$}200 MHz ms-1 toward lower frequencies. At higher radio frequencies, the subburst bandwidths and drift rate are larger, on average. While these features could be intrinsic to the burst emission mechanism, they could also be imparted by propagation effects in the medium local to the source. Comparison of the burst DMs with previous values in the literature suggests an increase of {$\Delta$}DM {$\sim$} 1\textendash 3 pc cm-3 in 4 yr; though, this could be a stochastic variation as opposed to a secular trend. This implies changes in the local medium or an additional source of frequency-dependent delay. Overall, the results are consistent with previously proposed scenarios in which FRB 121102 is embedded in a dense nebula.},

Here we report on the analysis of 478 bursts (333 previously unreported) from FRB~20121102A using the 305-m Arecibo telescope \textendash{} detected during approximately 59~hours of observations between December 2015 and October 2016. The majority of bursts are from a burst storm around September 2016. This is the earliest available sample of a large number of FRB~20121102A bursts, and it thus provides an anchor point for long-term studies of the source's evolving properties. We observe that the bursts separate into two groups in the width-bandwidth-energy parameter space, which we refer to as the low-energy bursts (LEBs) and high-energy bursts (HEBs). The LEBs are typically longer duration and narrower bandwidth than the HEBs, reminiscent of the spectro-temporal differences observed between the bursts of repeating and non-repeating FRBs. We fit the cumulative burst rate-energy distribution with a broken power law and find that it flattens out toward higher energies. The sample shows a diverse zoo of burst morphologies. Notably, burst emission seems to be more common at the top than the bottom of our 1150\textendash 1730\,MHz observing band. We also observe that bursts from the same day appear to be more similar to each other than to those of other days, but this observation requires confirmation. The wait times and burst rates that we measure are consistent with previous studies. We discuss these results, primarily in the context of magnetar models.},

We have developed tempo2, a new pulsar-timing package that contains propagation and other relevant effects implemented at the 1-ns level of precision (a factor of {$\sim$}100 more precise than previously obtainable). In contrast with earlier timing packages, tempo2 is compliant with the general relativistic framework of the IAU 1991 and 2000 resolutions and hence uses the International Celestial Reference System, Barycentric Coordinate Time and up-to-date precession, nutation and polar motion models. tempo2 provides a generic and extensible set of tools to aid in the analysis and visualization of pulsar-timing data. We provide an overview of the timing model, its accuracy and differences relative to earlier work. We also present a new scheme for predictive use of the timing model that removes existing processing artefacts by properly modelling the frequency dependence of pulse phase.}

We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest.

Robust and efficient methods that can aggregate data from multidimensional sparsely sampled time-series are needed. In this paper we present a new method for light curve period estimation based on quadratic mutual information (QMI). The proposed method does not assume a particular model for the light curve nor its underlying probability density and it is robust to non-Gaussian noise and outliers. By combining the QMI from several bands the true period can be estimated even when no single-band QMI yields the period. Period recovery performance as a function of average magnitude and sample size is measured using 30,000 synthetic multiband light curves of RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables generated by the LSST Operations and Catalog simulators. The results show that aggregating information from several bands is highly beneficial in LSST sparsely sampled time-series, obtaining an absolute increase in period recovery rate up to 50\%. We also show that the QMI is more robust to noise and light curve length (sample size) than the multiband generalizations of the Lomb\textendash Scargle and AoV periodograms, recovering the true period in 10\%\textendash 30\% more cases than its competitors.

The low-frequency band, however, is sensitive to exotic coherent and polarized radio-emission processes, such as electron-cyclotron maser emission from flaring M dwarfs1, stellar magnetospheric plasma interactions with exoplanets2 and a population of steep-spectrum pulsars3, making Galactic-plane searches a prospect for blind-transient discovery. Here we report an analysis of archival low-frequency radio data that reveals a periodic, low-frequency radio transient. We find that the source pulses every 18.18\,min, an unusual periodicity that has, to our knowledge, not been observed previously. The emission is highly linearly polarized, bright, persists for 30\textendash 60\,s on each occurrence and is visible across a broad frequency range. At times, the pulses comprise short-duration ({$<$}0.5\,s) bursts; at others, a smoother profile is observed. These profiles evolve on timescales of hours. By measuring the dispersion of the radio pulses with respect to frequency, we have localized the source to within our own Galaxy and suggest that it could be an ultra-long-period magnetar.},

Our results offer a significant increase in both accuracy and precision beyond those previously obtained. Using results from ASKAP and Parkes, we present our best-fitting FRB population parameters in a companion paper. Here, we consider in detail the expected and fitted distributions in redshift, dispersion measure, and signal to noise. We estimate that the unlocalized ASKAP FRBs arise from z {$<$} 0.5, with between a third and a half within z {$<$} 0.1. Our predicted source-counts ('logN-logS') distribution confirms previous indications of a steepening index near the Parkes detection threshold of 1 Jy ms. We find no evidence for a minimum FRB energy, and rule out Emin {$>$} 1039.0 erg at 90 per cent C.L. Importantly, we find that above a certain DM, observational biases cause the Macquart (DM-z) relation to become inverted, implying that the highest-DM events detected in the unlocalized Parkes and ASKAP samples are unlikely to be the most distant. More localized FRBs will be required to quantitatively estimate this effect, though its cause is a well-understood observational bias. Works assuming a 1-1 DM-z relation may therefore derive erroneous results. Our analysis of errors suggests that limiting factors in our analysis are understanding of FRB spectral behaviour, sensitivity response of search experiments, and the treatment of the repeating population and luminosity function.},

The detected burst occurred on 2018 November 19 and its emission extends down to at least 600 MHz, the lowest frequency detection of this source yet. The burst, detected with a significance of 23.7{$\sigma$}, has fluence 12 {$\pm$} 3 Jy ms and shows complex time and frequency morphology.

Previous derived FRB rates from surveys around 1.4~GHz, and favoured FRB interpretations, motivated this survey, despite all previous detections occurring at higher dispersion measures. We detected no new FRBs above a signal-to-noise threshold of 10, leading to the most stringent upper limit yet on the FRB event rate at these frequencies: 29 sky-1 d-1 for five ms-duration pulses above 62~Jy. The non-detection could be due to scatter-broadening, limitations on the volume and time searched, or the shape of FRB flux density spectra. Assuming the latter and that FRBs are standard candles, the non-detection is compatible with the published FRB sky rate, if their spectra follow a power law with frequency ({$\propto$}\,{$\nu\alpha$}), with {$\alpha~\greaterequivlnt~$}+0.1, demonstrating a marked difference from pulsar spectra. Our results suggest that surveys at higher frequencies, including the low frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array, will have better chances to detect, estimate rates and understand the origin and properties of FRBs.},

On each observing date we measure an equivalent pulse arrival time for PSR B1855+09 at 1.4 GHz, with typical accuracies of about 0.8 micrometers and for PSR B1937 + 21 at both 1.4 and 2.4 GHz, with accuracies around 0.2 micrometers. The pulse arrival times are fitted to a simple model for each pulsar, yielding high-precision astrometric, rotational, and orbital parameters, and a diverse range of conclusions. The celestial coordinates and proper motions of the two pulsars are determined with uncertainties less than or equal to 0.12 mas and less than or equal to 0.06 mas/year in the reference frame of the DE200 planetary ephemeris. The annual parallaxes are found to be pi=1.1 +/- 0.3 mas and pi less than 0.28 mas for PSRs B1855+09 and B1937+21, respectively. The general relativistic Shapiro delay is measured in the PSR B1855+09 system and used to obtain masses m1 = 1.50 +0.26 -0.14 solar mass and m (sub2) = 0.258 +0.028-0.016solar mass for the pulsar and its orbiting companion. The extremely stable orbital period of this system provides a phenomenological limit on the secular change of Newton's gravitational constant, dot-G/G=(-9 +/- 18) x 10-12/year. Variations in the dispersion measure of PSR B1937 + 21 indicate that the spectrum of electron-density fluctuations in the interstellar medi um has a power-law index beta = 3.874 +/- 0.011, slightly steeper than the Kolmogorov value of 11/3, and we find no strong evidence for an 'inner scale' greater than about 2 x 109cm. In the residual pulse arrival times for PSR B1937+21 we have observed small systematic trends not explained by our deterministic timing model. We discuss a number of possible causes; although the results are not yet conclusive, the most straightforward interpretation is that the unmodeled noise (a few microseconds over 8 yr, or Delta t/T approximately equals 10-14 is inherent to the pulsar itself. In the present data set, PSR B1855+09 exhibits no discernible timing noise. With conventional assumptions we derive a limit Omega g h2 less than 6 x 10-8 (95\% confidence) for the energy density, per logarithmic frequency interval, in a cosmic background of stochastic gravitational waves. We discuss the feasibility of establishing a pulsar-based timescale that might be used to test the stabilities of the best available atomic clocks. In an Appendix, we propose guidelines for the archiving of pulsar timing observations. Instructions are provided for obtaining copies of our own archival data, via Internet.},

Extensive monitoring of apparently non-repeating FRB has failed to find any repetitions. This suggests that the two types differ qualitatively, rather than in repetition rate, and are produced by distinct kinds of sources. The absence of periodicity in repeating FRB argues that they are not produced by neutron stars. They may originate in dilute relativistic jets produced by low luminosity black hole accretion. Non-repeating FRB may be produced by catastrophic events such as the collapse of an accreting magnetic neutron star to a black hole or of an accreting magnetic white dwarf to a neutron star, during which a disappearing magnetic moment radiates dipole radiation that accelerates electrons in nearby matter. If they are emitted by collimated beams of relativistic particles or charge `bunches' with Lorentz factor {$\gamma$}, their radiation is collimated into a solid angle {$\sim\gamma-$}2 sterad, reducing the energy requirement. If powered by magnetic reconnection, a pulse of length {$\Delta$}t may draw on the magnetic energy in a volume {$\sim\gamma$}4(c{$\Delta$}t)3, although only a fraction {$\sim$}1/{$\gamma$}2 of this may be dissipated without decollimation.},

  abstract = {Searches for fast radio bursts (FRBs) are underway at a growing number of radio telescopes worldwide. The sample size is now sufficient to enable many investigations into the population properties. As such, understanding the true sensitivity thresholds, effective observing time expended, survey completeness and parameter space coverage has become vital for calibrating the observed distributions. Recently the Molonglo FRB search team reported on their, as yet unique, efforts to inject synthetic FRB signals into their telescope data streams. Their results show 10 percent of injections being missed, even at very high signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. Their pipeline employs components considered standard across several telescopes so that the result is potentially alarming. In this paper we present a further look at these missed injections. It is shown that all of the missed injections can be explained by combinations of the noise statistics, mis-labelling, overly harsh data analysis cuts, incorrect S/N calculations and radio frequency interference. There is no need to be alarmed.},

The pulse has a dispersion measure of 746 cm-3 pc, a peak flux density of 400 mJy for the observed pulse width of 7.8 ms and a flat spectrum across a 288-MHz band centred on 1374 MHz. The flat spectrum suggests that the pulse did not originate from a pulsar, but is consistent with radio-emitting magnetar spectra. The non-detection of subsequent bursts constrains any possible pulsar period to {$\greaterequivlnt$}1 s, and the pulse energy distribution to being much flatter than typical giant pulse emitting pulsars. The burst is also consistent with the radio signal theorized from an annihilating mini black hole. Extrapolating the PMPS detection rate provides a limit of {$\Omega$}BH {$\lessequivlnt$} 5 \texttimes{} 10-14 on the density of these objects. We investigate the consistency of these two scenarios, plus several other possible solutions, as potential explanations to the origin of the pulse, as well as for another transient with similar properties: the Lorimer burst.},

The recent CHIME/FRB and STARE2 detection of an extremely bright (fluence\,\textasciitilde MJy\,ms) radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 supports the hypothesis that (at least some) fast radio bursts are emitted by magnetars at cosmological distances. In follow-up observations totalling 522.7\,h on source, we detect two bright radio bursts with fluences of 112\,{$\pm$}\,22\,Jy\,ms and 24\,{$\pm$}\,5\,Jy\,ms, respectively. Both bursts appear to be affected by interstellar scattering and we measure significant linear and circular polarization for the fainter burst. The bursts are separated in time by \textasciitilde 1.4\,s, suggesting a non-Poissonian, clustered emission process\textemdash similar to those seen in some repeating fast radio bursts. Together with the burst reported by CHIME/FRB and STARE2, as well as a much fainter burst seen by FAST (fluence 60\,mJy\,ms), our observations demonstrate that SGR 1935+2154 can produce bursts with apparent energies spanning roughly seven orders of magnitude, and that the burst rate is comparable across this range. This raises the question of whether these four bursts arise from similar physical processes, and whether the fast radio burst population distribution extends to very low energies (\textasciitilde 1030\,erg, isotropic equivalent).},

  abstract = {Single pixel feeds on large aperture radio telescopes have the ability to detect weak ({$\sim$}10{$\quad$}mJy) impulsive bursts of radio emission and sub-mJy radio pulsars. Unfortunately, in large-scale blind surveys, radio frequency interference (RFI) mimics both radio bursts and radio pulsars, greatly reducing the sensitivity to new discoveries as real signals of astronomical origin get lost among the millions of false candidates. In this paper a technique that takes advantage of multipixel feeds to use eigenvector decomposition of common signals is used to greatly facilitate radio burst and pulsar discovery. Since the majority of RFI occurs with zero dispersion, the method was tested on the total power present in the 13 beams of the Parkes multibeam receiver using data from archival intermediate-latitude surveys. The implementation of this method greatly reduced the number of false candidates and led to the discovery of one new rotating radio transient or RRAT, six new pulsars and five new pulses that shared the swept-frequency characteristics similar in nature to the `Lorimer burst'. These five new signals occurred within minutes of 11 previous detections of a similar type. When viewed together, they display temporal characteristics related to integer seconds, with non-random distributions and characteristic `gaps' between them, suggesting they are not from a naturally occurring source. Despite the success in removing RFI, false candidates present in the data that are only visible after integrating in time or at non-zero dispersion remained. It is demonstrated that with some computational penalty, the method can be applied iteratively at all trial dispersions and time resolutions to remove the vast majority of spurious candidates.},

The effectiveness of the spatial filtering techniques is demonstrated on observations of the Vela pulsar taken with the Parkes 20 cm Multibeam receiver.

No transient or pulsed emission was found using fast folding, fast Fourier transform, and single-pulse searches. The corresponding flux limits are about 0.01 mJy for pulsed emission, depending on the integration time for the particular source and assuming a duty cycle of 2\%, and 20 mJy for single dispersed pulses. These are the most sensitive limits to date on radio emission from X-ray dim isolated neutron stars. There is no evidence for isolated radio pulses, as seen in a class of neutron stars known as rotating radio transients. Our results imply that either the radio luminosities of these objects are lower than those of any known radio pulsars, or they could simply be long-period nearby radio pulsars with high magnetic fields beaming away from the Earth. To test the latter possibility, we would need around 40 similar sources to provide a 1{$\sigma$} probability of at least one of them beaming toward us. We also give a detailed description of our implementation of the Fast Folding Algorithm.},

This same technique may also be used in optical spectral observations of binary stars that possess a sufficiently high-quality determination of their radial velocity curve.},

They are also known to have much higher mean orbital velocities and accelerations than those of other binary pulsars. The system is therefore a good candidate for testing Einstein's theory of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime. We report on precision timing observations taken over the 2.5 years since its discovery and present four independent strong-field tests of general relativity. These tests use the theory-independent mass ratio of the two stars. By measuring relativistic corrections to the Keplerian description of the orbital motion, we find that the ``post-Keplerian'' parameter s agrees with the value predicted by general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05\%, the most precise test yet obtained. We also show that the transverse velocity of the system's center of mass is extremely small. Combined with the system's location near the Sun, this result suggests that future tests of gravitational theories with the double pulsar will supersede the best current solar system tests. It also implies that the second-born pulsar may not have formed through the core collapse of a helium star, as is usually assumed.},

  abstract = {We present results of the coordinated observing campaign that made the first subarcsecond localization of a fast radio burst, FRB 121102. During this campaign, we made the first simultaneous detection of an FRB burst using multiple telescopes: the VLA at 3 GHz and the Arecibo Observatory at 1.4 GHz. Of the nine bursts detected by the Very Large Array at 3 GHz, four had simultaneous observing coverage at other observatories at frequencies from 70 MHz to 15 GHz. The one multi-observatory detection and three non-detections of bursts seen at 3 GHz confirm earlier results showing that burst spectra are not well modeled by a power law. We find that burst spectra are characterized by a {$\sim$}500 MHz envelope and apparent radio energy as high as 1040 erg. We measure significant changes in the apparent dispersion between bursts that can be attributed to frequency-dependent profiles or some other intrinsic burst structure that adds a systematic error to the estimate of dispersion measure by up to 1\%. We use FRB 121102 as a prototype of the FRB class to estimate a volumetric birth rate of FRB sources Mpc-3 yr-1, where Nr is the number of bursts per source over its lifetime. This rate is broadly consistent with models of FRBs from young pulsars or magnetars born in superluminous supernovae or long gamma-ray bursts if the typical FRB repeats on the order of thousands of times during its lifetime.},

  abstract = {The on-going Arecibo Pulsar-ALFA (PALFA) survey began in 2004 and is searching for radio pulsars in the Galactic plane at 1.4 GHz. Here we present a comprehensive description of one of its main data reduction pipelines that is based on the PRESTO software and includes new interference-excision algorithms and candidate selection heuristics. This pipeline has been used to discover 40 pulsars, bringing the survey's discovery total to 144 pulsars. Of the new discoveries, eight are millisecond pulsars (MSPs; P {$<$} 10 ms) and one is a Fast Radio Burst (FRB). This pipeline has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsars, 60 of them previously discovered by the other PALFA pipelines. We present a novel method for determining the survey sensitivity that accurately takes into account the effects of interference and red noise: we inject synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters into real survey observations and then attempt to recover them with our pipeline. We find that the PALFA survey achieves the sensitivity to MSPs predicted by theoretical models but suffers a degradation for P  100 ms that gradually becomes up to {$\sim$}10 times worse for P {$>$} 4 s at DM {$<$} 150 pc cm-3. We estimate 33 {$\pm$} 3\% of the slower pulsars are missed, largely due to red noise. A population synthesis analysis using the sensitivity limits we measured suggests the PALFA survey should have found 224 {$\pm$} 16 un-recycled pulsars in the data set analyzed, in agreement with the 241 actually detected. The reduced sensitivity could have implications on estimates of the number of longperiod pulsars in the Galaxy.},

We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a series of simulations that challenge typical search techniques, including highly aliased signals, and relativistic binary systems. In the most extreme case, we simulate an 8~h observation containing 24 orbits of a pulsar in a binary with a 30\,M{$\odot$} companion. Even in this scenario we show that we can build up from an initial low-significance candidate, to fully recovering the signal. We also apply the method to survey data of three pulsars from the globular cluster 47Tuc: PSRs J0024-7204D, J0023-7203J and J0024-7204R. This final pulsar is in a 1.6~h binary, the shortest of any pulsar in 47Tuc, and additionally shows significant scintillation. By allowing the amplitude of the source to vary as a function of time, however, we show that we are able to obtain optimal combinations of such noisy data. We also demonstrate the ability of cobra to perform high-precision pulsar timing directly on the single pulse survey data, and obtain a 95\,per\,cent upper limit on the eccentricity of PSR J0024-7204R of {$\epsilon$}b~\&lt;~0.0007.},

However, the extent of the energy distribution towards the fainter end was not known. Here we report the detection of 1,652 independent bursts with a peak burst rate of 122\,h-1, in 59.5 hours spanning 47 days. A peak in the isotropic equivalent energy distribution is found to be approximately~4.8 \texttimes{} 1037 erg at 1.25 GHz, below which the detection of bursts is suppressed. The burst energy distribution is bimodal, and well characterized by a combination of a log-normal function and a generalized Cauchy function. The large number of bursts in hour-long spans allows sensitive periodicity searches between 1 ms and 1,000 s. The non-detection of any periodicity or quasi-periodicity poses challenges for models involving a single rotating compact object. The high burst rate also implies that FRBs must be generated with a high radiative efficiency, disfavouring emission mechanisms with large energy requirements or contrived triggering conditions.},

  abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short pulses observed in the radio band from cosmological distances1. One class of models invokes soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), or magnetars, as the sources of FRBs2. Some radio pulses have been observed from some magnetars3, but no FRB-like events have been detected in association with any magnetar burst, including one giant flare4. Recently, a pair of FRB-like bursts (termed FRB 200428) separated by 29 milliseconds were detected from the general direction of the Galactic magnetar SGR\,J1935+2154 (refs. 5,6). Here, we report the detection of a non-thermal X-ray burst in the 1\textendash 250 keV energy band with the Insight-HXMT satellite7, which we identify as having been emitted from SGR\,J1935+2154. The burst showed two hard peaks with a separation of 34 milliseconds, broadly consistent with that of the two bursts in FRB 200428. The delay time between the double radio peak and the X-ray peaks is about 8.62\,s, fully consistent with the dispersion delay of FRB 200428. We thus identify the non-thermal X-ray burst to be associated with FRB 200428, whose high-energy counterpart is the two hard X-ray peaks. Our results suggest that the non-thermal X-ray burst and FRB 200428 share the same physical origin in an explosive event from SGR J1935+2154.},

It has long been speculated that magnetars are the engine powering repeating bursts from FRB sources4\textendash 13, but no convincing evidence has been collected so far14. Recently, the Galactic magnetar SRG~1935+2154 entered an active phase by emitting intense soft {$\gamma$}-ray bursts15. One FRB-like event with two peaks (FRB~200428) and a luminosity slightly lower than the faintest extragalactic FRBs was detected from the source, in association with a soft {$\gamma$}-ray/hard-X-ray flare18\textendash 21. Here we report an eight-hour targeted radio observational campaign comprising four sessions and assisted by multi-wavelength (optical and hard-X-ray) data. During the third session, 29 soft-{$\gamma$}-ray repeater (SGR) bursts were detected in {$\gamma$}-ray energies. Throughout the observing period, we detected no single dispersed pulsed emission coincident with the arrivals of SGR bursts, but unfortunately we were not observing when the FRB was detected. The non-detection places a fluence upper limit that is eight orders of magnitude lower than the fluence of FRB~200428. Our results suggest that FRB\textendash SGR burst associations are rare. FRBs may be highly relativistic and geometrically beamed, or FRB-like events associated with SGR bursts may have narrow spectra and characteristic frequencies outside the observed band. It is also possible that the physical conditions required to achieve coherent radiation in SGR bursts are difficult to satisfy, and that~only under extreme conditions could an FRB be associated with an SGR burst.},

Fast and efficient search technology for FRBs is critical for triggering immediate multi-wavelength follow-up and voltage data dump. This paper proposes a dispersed dynamic spectra search (DDSS) pipeline for FRB searching based on deep learning, which performs the search directly from observational raw data, rather than relying on generated FRB candidates from single-pulse search algorithms that are based on de-dispersion. We train our deep learning network model using simulated FRBs as positive and negative samples extracted from the observational data of the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope (NSRT) at Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory. The observational data of PSR J1935+1616 are fed into the pipeline to verify the validity and performance of the pipeline. Results of the experiment show that our pipeline can efficiently search single-pulse events with a precision above 99.6\%, which satisfies the desired precision for selective voltage data dump. In March 2022, we successfully detected the FRBs emanating from the repeating case of FRB 20201124A with the DDSS pipeline in L-band observations using the NSRT. The DDSS pipeline shows excellent sensitivity in identifying weak single pulses, and its high precision greatly reduces the need for manual review.},

Thus, if astronomical, FRBs are probably extragalactic. FRB 110220 has a scattering tail of {$\sim$}5.6 {$\pm$} 0.1 ms. If the electron density fluctuations arise from a turbulent cascade, the scattering is unlikely to be due to propagation through the diffuse intergalactic plasma. A more plausible explanation is that this burst sits in the central region of its host galaxy. Pulse durations of order ms constrain the sizes of FRB sources implying high brightness temperatures that indicates coherent emission. Electric fields near FRBs at cosmological distances would be so strong that they could accelerate free electrons from rest to relativistic energies in a single wave period.},

In a series of two papers, we attempt to disentangle this mystery with machine learning methods. In this first paper, we focus on an array of supervised machine learning methods. We train the machine learning algorithms with a fraction of the observed FRBs in the first CHIME/FRB catalogue, telling them which ones are apparently non-repeating and which ones are repeating. We then let the trained models predict the repetitiveness of the rest of the FRB data with the observed parameters, and we compare the predictions with the observed repetitiveness. We find that the models can predict most FRBs correctly, hinting towards distinct mechanisms behind repeating and non-repeating FRBs. We also find that the two most important distinguishing factors between non-repeating and repeating FRBs are brightness temperature and rest-frame frequency bandwidth. By applying the trained models back to the entire first CHIME catalogue, we further identify some potentially repeating FRBs currently reported as non-repeating. We recommend a list of these bursts as targets for future observing campaigns to search for repeated bursts in a combination with the results presented in Paper II using unsupervised machine learning methods.},

  abstract = {The discovery and study of pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in time-domain radio data is often hampered by radio frequency interference (RFI). Some of this terrestrial RFI is impulsive and bright, and relatively easy to identify and remove. Other anthropogenic signals, however, are weaker yet periodic, and their persistence can drown out astrophysical signals. Here we show that Fourierdomain excision of periodic RFI is an effective and powerful step in detecting weak cosmic signals. We find that applying the method significantly increases the signal-to-noise ratio of transient as well as periodic pulsar signals. In live studies, we detected single pulses from pulsars and FRBs that would otherwise have remained buried in background noise. We show the method has no negative effects on pulsar pulse shape and that it enhances timing campaigns. We demonstrate the method on real-life data from number of large radio telescopes, and conclude that Fourier-domain RFI excision increases the effective sensitivity to astrophysical sources by a significant fraction which can be even larger than an order of magnitude in case of strong RFI. An accelerated implementation of the method runs on standard time-domain radio data formats and is publicly available.},

Censuses of the nearby Universe have used absorption line spectroscopy3,4 to observe the `invisible' baryons, but these measurements rely on large and uncertain corrections and are insensitive to most of the Universe's volume and probably most of its mass. In particular, quasar spectroscopy is sensitive either to the very small amounts of hydrogen that exist in the atomic state, or to highly ionized and enriched gas4\textendash 6 in denser regions near galaxies7. Other techniques to observe these invisible baryons also have limitations; Sunyaev\textendash Zel'dovich analyses8,9 can provide evidence from gas within filamentary structures, and studies of X-ray emission are most sensitive to gas near galaxy clusters9,10. Here we report a measurement of the baryon content of the Universe using the dispersion of a sample of localized fast radio bursts; this technique determines the electron column density along each line of sight and accounts for every ionized baryon11\textendash 13. We augment the sample of reported arcsecond-localized14\textendash 18 fast radio bursts with four new localizations in host galaxies that have measured redshifts of 0.291, 0.118, 0.378 and 0.522.

  abstract = {The millisecond-duration radio flashes known as fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent an enigmatic astrophysical phenomenon. Recently, the sub-arcsecond localization ({$\sim$}100 mas precision) of FRB 121102 using the Very Large Array has led to its unambiguous association with persistent radio and optical counterparts, and to the identification of its host galaxy. However, an even more precise localization is needed in order to probe the direct physical relationship between the millisecond bursts themselves and the associated persistent emission. Here, we report very-long-baseline radio interferometric observations using the European VLBI Network and the 305 m Arecibo telescope, which simultaneously detect both the bursts and the persistent radio emission at milliarcsecond angular scales and show that they are co-located to within a projected linear separation of {$\lessequivlnt$}40 pc ({$\lessequivlnt$}12 mas angular separation, at 95\% confidence). We detect consistent angular broadening of the bursts and persistent radio source ({$\sim$}2\textendash 4 mas at 1.7 GHz), which are both similar to the expected Milky Way scattering contribution. The persistent radio source has a projected size constrained to be {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.7 pc ({$\lessequivlnt$}0.2 mas angular extent at 5.0 GHz) and a lower limit for the brightness temperature of . Together, these observations provide strong evidence for a direct physical link between FRB 121102 and the compact persistent radio source. We argue that a burst source associated with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a young neutron star energizing a supernova remnant are the two scenarios for FRB 121102 that best match the observed data.},

Using the assumption that the scattering screens have not changed significantly in this time, we have modeled the variations in arc curvature throughout the Earth's orbit and extracted information about the placement, orientation, and velocity of five of the six screens, with the highest-precision distance measurement placing a screen at just \$5.46\^\{+0.54\}\_\{-0.59\}\$ pc from the Earth.

Several short bursts with fluence of erg cm-2 were detected by the Imager on-board INTEGRAL (IBIS) instrument in the 20\textendash 200 keV range. The burst with the hardest spectrum, discovered and localized in real time by the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System, was spatially and temporally coincident with a short and very bright radio burst detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and Survey for Transient Astronomical Radio Emission 2 (STARE2) radio telescopes at 400\textendash 800 MHz and 1.4 GHz, respectively. Its lightcurve shows three narrow peaks separated by {$\sim$}29 ms time intervals, superimposed on a broad pulse lasting {$\sim$}0.6 s. The brightest peak had a delay of 6.5 {$\pm$} 1.0 ms with respect to the 1.4 GHz radio pulse (that coincides with the second and brightest component seen at lower frequencies). The burst spectrum, an exponentially cutoff power law with photon index and peak energy , is harder than those of the bursts usually observed from this and other magnetars. By the analysis of an expanding dust-scattering ring seen in X-rays with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope (XRT) instrument, we derived a distance of kpc for SGR 1935+2154, independent of its possible association with the supernova remnant G57.2+0.8. At this distance, the burst 20\textendash 200 keV fluence of erg cm-2 corresponds to an isotropic emitted energy of erg.

Here we derive from first principles that an FFA search closely approaches the theoretical optimum sensitivity to all periodic signals; it is analytically shown to be significantly more sensitive than the standard FFT+IHS method, regardless of pulse period and duty cycle. A portion of the pulsar phase space has thus been systematically under-explored for decades; pulsar surveys aiming to fully sample the pulsar population should include an FFA search as part of their data analysis. We have developed an FFA software package, riptide, fast enough to process radio observations on a large scale; riptide has already discovered sources undetectable using existing FFT+IHS implementations. Our sensitivity comparison between search techniques also shows that a more realistic radiometer equation is needed, which includes an additional term: the search efficiency. We derive the theoretical efficiencies of both the FFA and the FFT+IHS methods and discuss how excluding this term has consequences for pulsar population synthesis studies.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of PSR~J2251-3711, a radio pulsar with a spin period of 12.1 s, the second longest currently known. Its timing parameters imply a characteristic age of 15~Myr, a surface magnetic field of 1.3~\texttimes ~1013~G, and a spin-down luminosity of 2.9~\texttimes ~1029~erg\,s-1. Its dispersion measure of 12.12(1)~pc\,cm-3 leads to distance estimates of 0.5 and 1.3~kpc according to the NE2001 and YMW16 Galactic free electron density models, respectively. Some of its single pulses show an uninterrupted 180-deg sweep of the phase-resolved polarization position angle, with an S-shape reminiscent of the rotating vector model prediction. However, the fact that this sweep occurs at different phases from one pulse to another is remarkable and without straightforward explanation. Although PSR~J2251-3711 lies in the region of the \$P-\textbackslash dot\{P\}\$ parameter space occupied by the X-ray isolated neutron stars (XINS), there is no evidence for an X-ray counterpart in our Swift XRT observation; this places a 99~per\,cent-confidence upper bound on its unabsorbed bolometric thermal luminosity of \$1.1 \textbackslash times 10\^\{31\}\textasciitilde (d / 1\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\})\^2\textasciitilde\textbackslash mathrm\{erg\textbackslash, s\}\^\{-1\}\$ for an assumed temperature of 85~eV, where d is the distance to the pulsar. Further observations are needed to determine whether it is a rotation-powered pulsar with a true age of at least several Myr, or a much younger object such as an XINS or a recently cooled magnetar. Extreme specimens like PSR J2251-3711 help bridge populations in the so-called neutron star zoo in an attempt to understand their origins and evolution.},

FRBs exhibit a variety of spectral, temporal and polarimetric properties that can unveil clues into their emission physics and propagation effects in the local medium. Here, we present the high-time-resolution (down to 1\,{$\mu$}s) polarimetric properties of four 1.7\,GHz bursts from the repeating FRB\,20180916B, which were detected in voltage data during observations with the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network. We observe a range of emission timescales that spans three orders of magnitude, with the shortest component width reaching 3\textendash 4\,{$\mu$}s (below which we are limited by scattering). We demonstrate that all four bursts are highly linearly polarized ({$\greaterequivlnt$}80\%), show no evidence of significant circular polarization ({$\lessequivlnt$}15\%), and exhibit a constant polarization position angle (PPA) during and between bursts. On short timescales ({$\lessequivlnt$}100\,{$\mu$}s), however, there appear to be subtle PPA variations (of a few degrees) across the burst profiles. These observational results are most naturally explained in an FRB model in which the emission is magnetospheric in origin, in contrast to models in which the emission originates at larger distances in a relativistic shock.},

Together with FRB 181123, which was reported earlier, all four FAST-discovered FRBs share the same characteristics of low fluence ({$\leq$}0.2 Jy ms) and high dispersion measure (DM, {$>$}1000 pc cm-3), consistent with the anticorrelation between DM and fluence of the entire FRB population. FRB 181118 and FRB 181130 exhibit band-limited features. FRB 181130 is prominently scattered ({$\tau$} s {$\simeq$} 8 ms) at 1.25 GHz. FRB 181017.J0036+11 has full-bandwidth emission with a fluence of 0.042 Jy ms, which is one of the faintest FRB sources detected so far. CRAFTS has started to build a new sample of FRBs that fills the region for more distant and fainter FRBs in the fluence\textendash DME diagram, previously out of reach of other surveys. The implied all-sky event rate of FRBs is sky-1 day-1 at the 95\% confidence interval above 0.0146 Jy ms. We also demonstrate here that the probability density function of CRAFTS FRB detections is sensitive to the assumed intrinsic FRB luminosity function and cosmological evolution, which may be further constrained with more discoveries.},

In this fourth paper of the series, we present a systematic search of the spin period and linear acceleration of the source object from both 996 individual pulse peaks and the dedispersed time series. No credible spin period was found from this data set. We rule out the presence of significant periodicity in the range between 1 ms to 100 s with a pulse duty cycle \${$<$} 0.49\textbackslash pm0.08\$ (when the profile is defined by a von-Mises function, not a boxcar function) and linear acceleration up to \$300\$ m s\$\^\{-2\}\$ in each of the four one-hour observing sessions, and up to \$0.6\$ m s\$\^\{-2\}\$ in all 4 days. These searches contest theoretical scenarios involving a 1 ms to 100 s isolated magnetar/pulsar with surface magnetic field \${$<$}10\^\{15\}\$ G and a small duty cycle (such as in a polar-cap emission mode) or a pulsar with a companion star or black hole up to 100 M\$\_\{\textbackslash rm \textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$P\_b{$>$}10\$ hours. We also perform a periodicity search of the fine structures and identify 53 unrelated millisecond-timescale "periods" in multi-components with the highest significance of 3.9 \$\textbackslash sigma\$. The "periods" recovered from the fine structures are neither consistent nor harmonically related. Thus they are not likely to come from a spin period. We caution against claiming spin periodicity with significance below \$\textbackslash sim\$ 4 \$\textbackslash sigma\$ with multi-components from one-off FRBs. We discuss the implications of our results and the possible connections between FRB multi-components and pulsar micro-structures.},

We present an initial study of the application of the wideband timing technique, which can simultaneously measure the pulsar times of arrivals (ToAs) and DMs, for a set of five pulsars observed with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) as part of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) campaign. We have used the observations with the 300\textendash 500\,MHz band of the uGMRT for this purpose. We obtain high precision in DM measurements with precisions of the order 10-6\,cm-3\,pc. The ToAs obtained have sub-{$\mu$}s precision and the rms of the post-fit ToA residuals are in the sub-{$\mu$}s range. We find that the uncertainties in the DMs and ToAs obtained with this wideband technique, applied to low-frequency data, are consistent with the results obtained with traditional pulsar timing techniques and comparable to high-frequency results from other PTAs. This work opens up an interesting possibility of using low-frequency wideband observations for precision pulsar timing and gravitational wave detection with similar precision as high-frequency observations used conventionally.},

On the other hand, despite dozens of hours of telescope time spent on follow-up observations, no other fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed to repeat. Yet, it has been speculated that the repeater is the prototype of FRBs, and that other FRBs should show similar repeating patterns. Using the published data, we compare the repeater with other FRBs in the observed time interval ({$\Delta$}t)\textendash flux ratio (Si/Si+1) plane. We find that whereas other FRBs occupy the upper (large Si/Si+1) and right (large {$\Delta$}t) regions of the plane due to the non-detections of other bursts, some of the repeater bursts fall into the lower left region of the plot (short interval and small flux ratio) excluded by the non-detection data of other FRBs. The trend also exists even if one only selects those bursts detectable by the Parkes radio telescope. If other FRBs were similar to the repeater, our simulations suggest that the probability that none of them have been detected to repeat with the current searches would be {$\sim$}(10-4\textendash 10-3). We suggest that the repeater is not representative of the entire FRB population, and that there is strong evidence of more than one population of FRBs.},

  abstract = {The Pulsar Arecibo L-Band Feed Array (PALFA) survey, the most sensitive blind search for radio pulsars yet conducted, is ongoing at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The vast majority of the 180 pulsars discovered by PALFA have spin periods shorter than 2 s. Pulsar surveys may miss long-period radio pulsars owing to the summing of a finite number of harmonic components in conventional Fourier analyses (typically {$\sim$}16), or as a result of the strong effect of red noise at low modulation frequencies. We address this reduction in sensitivity by using a time-domain search technique: the fast-folding algorithm (FFA). We designed a program that implements an FFA-based search in the PALFA processing pipeline and tested the efficiency of the algorithm by performing tests under both ideal, white-noise conditions, as well as with real PALFA observational data. In the two scenarios, we show that the time-domain algorithm has the ability to outperform the FFT-based periodicity search implemented in the survey. We perform simulations to compare the previously reported PALFA sensitivity with that obtained using our new FFA implementation. These simulations show that for a pulsar having a pulse duty cycle of roughly 3\%, the performance of our FFA pipeline exceeds that of our FFT pipeline for pulses with dispersion measure {$\lessequivlnt$} 40 pc cm-3 and for periods as short as {$\sim$}500 ms, and that the survey sensitivity is improved by at least a factor of two for periods {$\greaterequivlnt$} 6 s. Early results from the implementation of the algorithm in PALFA, including discoveries, are also presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extragalactic astrophysical transients1 whose brightness requires emitters that are highly energetic yet compact enough to produce the short, millisecond-duration bursts. FRBs have thus far been detected at frequencies from 8~gigahertz (ref. 2) down to 300~megahertz (ref. 3), but lower-frequency emission has remained elusive. Some FRBs repeat4\textendash 6, and one of the most frequently detected, FRB~20180916B7, has a periodicity cycle of 16.35~days (ref. 8). Using simultaneous radio data spanning a wide range of wavelengths (a factor of more than 10), here we show that FRB~20180916B emits down to 120~megahertz, and that its activity window is frequency dependent (that is, chromatic). The window is both narrower and earlier at higher frequencies. Binary wind interaction models predict a wider window at higher frequencies, the opposite of our observations. Our full-cycle coverage shows that the 16.3-day periodicity is not aliased. We establish that low-frequency FRB emission can escape the local medium. For bursts of the same fluence, FRB~20180916B is more active below 200~megahertz than at 1.4~gigahertz. Combining our results with previous upper limits on the all-sky FRB rate at 150~megahertz, we find there are 3\textendash 450 FRBs in the sky per day above 50~Jy~ms. Our chromatic results strongly disfavour scenarios in which absorption from strong stellar winds causes FRB periodicity. We demonstrate that some FRBs are found in `clean' environments that do not absorb or scatter low-frequency radiation.},

The observations of FRB 121102 were performed simultaneously at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz, and spanned a total of 27.3 hr between 2019 September 19 and 2020 February 11. We detected two radio bursts in the 2.3 GHz frequency band from FRB 121102, but no evidence of radio emission was found at 8.4 GHz during any of our observations.

However, no radio bursts were detected from FRB 180916.J0158+65 at any of the frequencies used during our observations with the DSN radio telescopes. We find that FRB 180916.J0158+65's apparent activity is strongly frequency-dependent due to the narrowband nature of its radio bursts, which have less spectral occupancy at high radio frequencies ({$\greaterequivlnt$} 2 GHz). We also find that fewer or fainter bursts are emitted from the source at high radio frequencies. We discuss the implications of these results for possible progenitor models of repeating FRBs.},

  abstract = {We present an algorithm for the simultaneous measurement of a pulse time-of-arrival (TOA) and dispersion measure (DM) from folded wideband pulsar data. We extend the prescription from Taylor (1992) to accommodate a general two-dimensional template "portrait", the alignment of which can be used to measure a pulse phase and DM. We show that there is a dedispersion reference frequency that removes the covariance between these two quantities, and note that the recovered pulse profile scaling amplitudes can provide useful information. We experiment with pulse modeling by using a Gaussian-component scheme that allows for independent component evolution with frequency, a "fiducial component", and the inclusion of scattering. We showcase the algorithm using our publicly available code on three years of wideband data from the bright millisecond pulsar J1824-2452A (M28A) from the Green Bank Telescope, and a suite of Monte Carlo analyses validates the algorithm. By using a simple model portrait of M28A we obtain DM trends comparable to those measured by more standard methods, with improved TOA and DM precisions by factors of a few. Measurements from our algorithm will yield precisions at least as good as those from traditional techniques, but is prone to fewer systematic effects and is without ad hoc parameters. A broad application of this new method for dispersion measure tracking with modern large-bandwidth observing systems should improve the timing residuals for pulsar timing array experiments, like the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves.},

We review the different relations between pulsars and time scales and estimate the intrinsic stability of each. We show how atomic time can benefit from an ensemble pulsar time and how such an ensemble may presently reveal some long term instabilities in atomic time. Finally the observations of a pulsar in a binary system allow to generate a binary pulsar time, which is the most accurate astronomical time scale.},

  abstract = {The discovery of radio pulsars over a half century ago was a seminal moment in astronomy. It demonstrated the existence of neutron stars, gave a powerful observational tool to study them, and has allowed us to probe strong gravity, dense matter, and the interstellar medium. More recently, pulsar surveys have led to the serendipitous discovery of fast radio bursts (FRBs). While FRBs appear similar to the individual pulses from pulsars, their large dispersive delays suggest that they originate from far outside the Milky Way and hence are many orders-of-magnitude more luminous. While most FRBs appear to be one-off, perhaps cataclysmic events, two sources are now known to repeat and thus clearly have a longer lived central engine. Beyond understanding how they are created, there is also the prospect of using FRBs\textemdash as with pulsars\textemdash to probe the extremes of the Universe as well as the otherwise invisible intervening medium. Such studies will be aided by the high-implied all-sky event rate: there is a detectable FRB roughly once every minute occurring somewhere on the sky. The fact that less than a hundred FRB sources have been discovered in the last decade is largely due to the small fields-of-view of current radio telescopes. A new generation of wide-field instruments is now coming online, however, and these will be capable of detecting multiple FRBs per day. We are thus on the brink of further breakthroughs in the short-duration radio transient phase space, which will be critical for differentiating between the many proposed theories for the origin of FRBs. In this review, we give an observational and theoretical introduction at a level that is accessible to astronomers entering the field.},

  abstract = {Since the discovery of the first fast radio burst (FRB) in 2007, and their confirmation as an abundant extragalactic population in 2013, the study of these sources has expanded at an incredible rate. In our 2019 review on the subject, we presented a growing, but still mysterious, population of FRBs\textemdash 60 unique sources, 2 repeating FRBs, and only 1 identified host galaxy. However, in only a few short years, new observations and discoveries have given us a wealth of information about these sources. The total FRB population now stands at over 600 published sources, 24 repeaters, and 19 host galaxies. Higher time resolution data, sustained monitoring, and precision localisations have given us insight into repeaters, host galaxies, burst morphology, source activity, progenitor models, and the use of FRBs as cosmological probes. The recent detection of a bright FRB-like burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR~1935 + 2154 provides an important link between FRBs and magnetars. There also continue to be surprising discoveries, like periodic modulation of activity from repeaters and the localisation of one FRB source to a relatively nearby globular cluster associated with the M81 galaxy. In this review, we summarise the exciting observational results from the past few years. We also highlight their impact on our understanding of the FRB population and proposed progenitor models. We build on the introduction to FRBs in our earlier review, update our readers on recent results, and discuss interesting avenues for exploration as the field enters a new regime where hundreds to thousands of new FRBs will be discovered and reported each year.},

In fact, their similarity to FRB 010724 had previously cast a shadow over the interpretation of `fast radio bursts' (FRBs), which otherwise appear to be of extragalactic origin. Until now, the physical origin of the dispersion-mimicking perytons had remained a mystery. We have identified strong out-of-band emission at 2.3\textendash 2.5~GHz associated with several peryton events. Subsequent tests revealed that a peryton can be generated at 1.4~GHz when a microwave oven door is opened prematurely and the telescope is at an appropriate relative angle. Radio emission escaping from microwave ovens during the magnetron shut-down phase neatly explains all of the observed properties of the peryton signals. Now that the peryton source has been identified, we furthermore demonstrate that the microwave ovens on site could not have caused FRB 010724. This and other distinct observational differences show that FRBs are excellent candidates for genuine extragalactic transients.},

  abstract = {Pulsar timing is a process of iteratively fitting pulse arrival times to constrain the spindown, astrometric, and possibly binary parameters of a pulsar, by enforcing integer numbers of pulsar rotations between the arrival times. Phase connection is the process of unambiguously determining those rotation numbers between the times of arrival (TOAs) while determining a pulsar timing solution. Pulsar timing currently requires a manual process of step-by-step phase connection performed by individuals. In an effort to quantify and streamline this process, we created the Algorithmic Pulsar Timer, APT, an algorithm which can accurately phase connect and time isolated pulsars. Using the statistical F-test and knowledge of parameter uncertainties and covariances, the algorithm decides what new data to include in a fit, when to add additional timing parameters, and which model to attempt in subsequent iterations. Using these tools, the algorithm can phase-connect timing data that previously required substantial manual effort. We tested the algorithm on 100 simulated systems, with a 99\% success rate. APT combines statistical tests and techniques with a logical decision-making process, very similar to the manual one used by pulsar astronomers for decades, and some computational brute-force, to automate the often tricky process of isolated pulsar phase connection, setting the foundation for automated fitting of binary pulsar systems.},

  abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) represent one of the most exciting astrophysical discoveries of the recent past. The study of their low-frequency emission, which was only effectively picked up about ten years after their discovery, has helped shape the field thanks to some of the most important detections to date. Observations between 400 and 800 MHz, carried out by the CHIME/FRB telescope, in particular, have led to the detection of {$\sim$}500 FRBs in little more than 1 year and, among them, {$\sim$}20 repeating sources. Detections at low frequencies have uncovered a nearby population that we can study in detail via continuous monitoring and targeted campaigns. The latest, most important discoveries include: periodicity, both at the days level in repeaters and at the millisecond level in apparently non-repeating sources; the detection of an FRB-like burst from a galactic magnetar; and the localisation of an FRB inside a globular cluster in a nearby galaxy. The systematic study of the population at low frequencies is important for the characterisation of the environment surrounding the FRBs and, at a global level, to understand the environment of the local universe. This review is intended to give an overview of the efforts leading to the current rich variety of low-frequency studies and to put into a common context the results achieved in order to trace a possible roadmap for future progress in the field.},

We identify four observed archetypes of burst morphology (``simple broadband,'' ``simple narrowband,'' ``temporally complex,'' and ``downward drifting'') and describe relevant instrumental biases that are essential for interpreting the observed morphologies. Using the catalog properties of the FRBs, we confirm that bursts from repeating sources, on average, have larger widths, and we show, for the first time, that bursts from repeating sources, on average, are narrower in bandwidth. This difference could be due to beaming or propagation effects, or it could be intrinsic to the populations.

Its proximity ({$\sim$}150 Mpc), along with detailed studies of the bursts, has revealed many clues about its nature, including a 16.3 day periodicity in its activity. Here we report on the detection of 18 bursts using LOFAR at 110\textendash 188 MHz, by far the lowest-frequency detections of any FRB to date. Some bursts are seen down to the lowest observed frequency of 110 MHz, suggesting that their spectra extend even lower. These observations provide an order-of-magnitude stronger constraint on the optical depth due to free\textendash free absorption in the source's local environment. The absence of circular polarization and nearly flat polarization angle curves are consistent with burst properties seen at 300\textendash 1700 MHz. Compared with higher frequencies, the larger burst widths ({$\sim$}40\textendash 160 ms at 150 MHz) and lower linear polarization fractions are likely due to scattering. We find {$\sim$}2\textendash 3 rad m-2 variations in the Faraday rotation measure that may be correlated with the activity cycle of the source. We compare the LOFAR burst arrival times to those of 38 previously published and 22 newly detected bursts from the uGMRT (200\textendash 450 MHz) and CHIME/FRB (400\textendash 800 MHz). Simultaneous observations show five CHIME/FRB bursts when no emission is detected by LOFAR. We find that the burst activity is systematically delayed toward lower frequencies by about 3 days from 600 to 150 MHz. We discuss these results in the context of a model in which FRB 20180916B is an interacting binary system featuring a neutron star and high-mass stellar companion.},

Here we calculate the effect of retardation due to the companion's motion on various time delays in pulsar binaries, including the Shaipro delay, the geometric lensing delay, and the lens-induced delays associated with the pulsar rotation. Our results can be applied to systems so highly inclined that near conjunction gravitational lensing of the pulsar radiation by the companion becomes important (the recently discovered double pulsar system J0737-3039 may exemplify such a system). To the leading order, the effect of retardation is to shift all the delay curves backward in time around the orbit conjunction, without affecting the shape and amplitude of the curves. The time shift is of order the photon orbit crossing time, and ranges from a second to a few minutes for the observed binary pulsar systems. In the double pulsar system J0737-3039, the motion of the companion may also affect the interpretation of the recent correlated interstellar scintillation measurements. Finally, we show that lensing sets an upper limit on the magnitude of the frame-dragging time delay caused by the companion's spin, and makes this delay unobservable in stellar-mass binary pulsar systems.}

FRB~121102 is the most well-studied repeating FRB but despite extensive monitoring of the source, no underlying pattern in the repetition has previously been identified. Here, we present the results from a radio monitoring campaign of FRB~121102 using the 76\,m Lovell telescope. Using the pulses detected in the Lovell data along with pulses from the literature, we report a detection of periodic behaviour of the source over the span of 5\,yr of data. We predict that the source is currently `off' and that it should turn `on' for the approximate MJD range 59002-59089 (2020 June 2 to 2020 August 28). This result, along with the recent detection of periodicity from another repeating FRB, highlights the need for long-term monitoring of repeating FRBs at a high cadence. Using simulations, we show that one needs at least 100\,h of telescope time to follow-up repeating FRBs at a cadence of 0.5\textendash 3\,d to detect periodicities in the range of 10\textendash 150\,d. If the period is real, it shows that repeating FRBs can have a large range in their activity periods that might be difficult to reconcile with neutron star precession models.},

  abstract = {We present an assortment of both standard and advanced Fourier techniques that are useful in the analysis of astrophysical time series of very long duration-where the observation time is much greater than the time resolution of the individual data points. We begin by reviewing the operational characteristics of Fourier transforms of time-series data, including power-spectral statistics, discussing some of the differences between analyses of binned data, sampled data, and event data, and we briefly discuss algorithms for calculating discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) of very long time series. We then discuss the response of DFTs to periodic signals and present techniques to recover Fourier amplitude ``lost'' during simple traditional analyses if the periodicities change frequency during the observation. These techniques include Fourier interpolation, which allows us to correct the response for signals that occur between Fourier frequency bins. We then present techniques for estimating additional signal properties such as the signal's centroid and duration in time, the first and second derivatives of the frequency, the pulsed fraction, and an overall estimate of the significance of a detection. Finally, we present a recipe for a basic but thorough Fourier analysis of a time series for well-behaved pulsations.},

  abstract = {We describe a new and efficient technique, which we call sideband or phase-modulation searching, that allows one to detect short-period binary pulsars in observations longer than the orbital period. The orbital motion of the pulsar during long observations effectively modulates the phase of the pulsar signal, causing sidebands to appear around the pulsar spin frequency and its harmonics in the Fourier transform. For the majority of binary radio pulsars or low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), large numbers of sidebands are present, allowing efficient searches using Fourier transforms of short portions of the original power spectrum. Analysis of the complex amplitudes and phases of the sidebands can provide enough information to solve for the Keplerian orbital parameters. This technique is particularly applicable to radio pulsar searches in globular clusters and searches for coherent X-ray pulsations from LMXBs and is complementary to more standard ``acceleration'' searches.},

Their dispersion measures\textemdash which are greater than would be expected if they had propagated only through the interstellar medium of the Milky Way\textemdash indicate extragalactic origins and imply contributions from the intergalactic medium and perhaps from other galaxies2. Although several theories exist regarding the sources of these fast radio bursts, their intensities, durations and temporal structures suggest coherent emission from highly magnetized plasma3,4. Two of these bursts have been observed to repeat5,6, and one repeater (FRB~121102) has been localized to the largest star-forming region of a dwarf galaxy at a cosmological redshift of 0.19 (refs. 7\textendash 9). However, the host galaxies and distances of the hitherto non-repeating fast radio bursts are yet to be identified. Unlike repeating sources, these events must be observed with an interferometer that has sufficient spatial resolution for arcsecond localization at the time of discovery. Here we report the localization of a fast radio burst (FRB~190523) to a few-arcsecond region containing a single massive galaxy at a redshift of 0.66. This galaxy is different from the host of FRB~121102, as it is a thousand times more massive, with a specific star-formation rate (the star-formation rate divided by the mass) a hundred times smaller.},

Young, highly magnetized, isolated neutron stars\textemdash magnetars\textemdash have been suggested as the most promising candidates for FRB progenitors owing to their energetics and high X-ray flaring activity2,3. Here we report the detection with Konus-Wind of a hard X-ray event of 28 April 2020 temporally coincident with a bright, two-peak radio burst4,5 in the direction of Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154, with properties remarkably similar to those of FRBs. We show that the two peaks of the double-peaked X-ray burst coincide in time with the radio peaks and infer a common source and the association of these phenomena. An unusual hardness of the X-ray spectrum strongly distinguishes the 28 April event among multiple `ordinary' flares from SGR 1935+2154. A recent non-detection5\textendash 7 of radio emission from about 100 typical soft bursts from SGR 1935+2154 favours the idea that bright, FRB-like magnetar signals are associated with rare, hard-spectrum X-ray bursts.

This gating correlator accounts for the orbital motions of MSPs in binaries while folding the visibilities with best-fit topocentric rotational model derived from periodicity search in simultaneously generated beamformer output. Unique applications of the gating correlator for sensitive interferometric studies of MSPs are illustrated using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) interferometric array. We could unambiguously localise five newly discovered Fermi MSPs in the on-off gated image plane with an accuracy of +-1". Immediate knowledge of such precise position allows the use of sensitive coherent beams of array telescopes for follow-up timing observations, which substantially reduces the use of telescope time (\textasciitilde{} 20X for the GMRT). In addition, precise a-priori astrometric position reduces the effect of large covariances in timing fit (with discovery position, pulsar period derivative and unknown binary model), which in-turn accelerates the convergence to initial timing model. For example, while fitting with precise a-priori position (+-1"), timing model converges in about 100 days, accounting the effect of covariance between position and pulsar period derivative. Moreover, such accurate positions allows for rapid identification of pulsar counterpart at other wave-bands. We also report a new methodology of in-beam phase calibration using the on-off gated image of the target pulsar, which provides the optimal sensitivity of the coherent array removing the possible temporal and spacial decoherences.},

Using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), we illustrate the application of this efficient technique, which combines the enhanced sensitivity of a coherent array beamformer with the wide field-of-view seen by an incoherent array beamformer. Multi-pixel beamformer algorithm is implemented using the recorded base-band data. With the optimisations in multi-pixelisation described in this paper, it is now possible to form 16 directed beams in real-time. We discuss a special application of this technique, where we use continuum imaging followed by the multi-pixel beamformer to obtain the precise locations of newly discovered millisecond pulsars with the GMRT. Accurate positions measured with single observations enable highly sensitive follow-up studies using coherent array beamformer and rapid follow up at higher radio frequencies and other wavelengths. Normally, such accurate positions can only be obtained from a long-term pulsar timing program. The multi-pixel beamformer technique can also be used for highly sensitive targeted pulsar searches in extended supernova remnants. In addition this method can provide optimal performance for the large scale pulsar surveys using multi-element arrays.},

Using data from the GMRT we show that post-correlation beamformation results in a many-folds increase in the signal-to-noise for periodic signals from pulsars and several order of magnitude reduction in the number of false triggers from single pulse events like fast radio bursts (FRBs). This difference arises primarily because the post-correlation beam contains less red-noise, as well as less radio frequency interference. The post-correlation beam can also be more easily calibrated than the incoherent or phased array beams. We also discuss two different modes of post-correlation beamformation, viz. (1) by subtracting the incoherent beam from the coherent beam and (2) by phased addition of the visibilities. The computational costs for both these beamformation techniques as well as their suitability for studies of pulsars and FRBs are discussed. Techniques discussed here would be of interest for all upcoming surveys with interferometric arrays. Finally, we describe a time-domain survey with the GMRT using the post-correlation beamformation as a case study. We find that post-correlation beamforming will improve the current GMRT time-domain survey sensitivity by \textasciitilde{} 2 times for pulsars with periods of few 100s of millisecond and by many-folds for even slower pulsars, making it one of the most sensitive surveys for pulsars and FRBs at low and mid radio frequencies.},

There is also a clear indication of high activity of the source at a higher frequency during earlier phases of the activity cycle. We identify a gradual decrease in the rotation measure over two years and no significant variations in the dispersion measure. We derive useful conclusions about progenitor scenarios, energy distribution, emission mechanisms, and variation of the downward drift rate of emission with frequency.

The orthogonal polynomials constitute a flexible and numerically efficient model of the observations. Among all popular statistics, ANOVA has optimum detection properties as the uniformly most powerful test. Our recurrence algorithm for expansion of the observations into the orthogonal polynomials is fast and numerically stable. The expansion is equivalent to an expansion into Fourier series. Aside from its use of an inefficient statistic, the Lomb-Scargle power spectrum can be considered a special case of our method. Tests of our new method on simulated and real light curves of nonsinusoidal pulsators demonstrate its excellent performance.

  abstract = {Pulsars have been studied extensively over the last few decades and have proven instrumental in exploring a wide variety of physics. Discovering more pulsars emitting at low radio frequencies is crucial to further our understanding of spectral properties and emission mechanisms. The Murchison Widefield Array Voltage Capture System (MWA VCS) has been routinely used to study pulsars at low frequencies and discover new pulsars. The MWA VCS offers the unique opportunity of recording complex voltages from all individual antennas (tiles), which can be off-line beamformed or correlated/imaged at millisecond time resolution. Devising imaged-based methods for finding pulsar candidates, which can be verified in beamformed data, can accelerate the complete process and lead to more pulsar detections. Image-based searches for pulsar candidates can reduce the number of tied-array beams required, increasing compute resource efficiency. Despite a factor of {$\sim$} 4 loss in sensitivity, searching for pulsar candidates in images from the MWA VCS, we can explore a larger parameter space, potentially leading to discoveries of pulsars missed by high-frequency surveys such as steep spectrum pulsars, exotic binary systems, or pulsars obscured in high-time resolution timeseries data by propagation effects. Image-based searches are also essential to probing parts of parameter space inaccessible to traditional beamformed searches with the MWA (e.g. at high dispersion measures). In this paper we describe the innovative approach and capability of dual-processing MWA VCS data, that is forming 1-second visibilities and sky images, finding pulsar candidates in these images, and verifying by forming tied-array beam. We developed and tested image-based methods of finding pulsar candidates, which are based on pulsar properties such as steep spectral index, polarisation and variability. The efficiency of these methodologies has been verified on known pulsars, and the main limitations explained in terms of sensitivity and low-frequency spectral turnover of some pulsars. No candidates were confirmed to be a new pulsar, but this new capability will now be applied to a larger subset of observations to accelerate pulsar discoveries with the MWA and potentially speed up future searches with the SKA-Low.},

In this work, we present an investigation of temporal variations of interstellar medium for a set of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) with the upgraded GMRT aided by large fractional bandwidth at lower observing frequencies. Contrary to the conventional narrow-band analysis using a frequency invariant template profile, we applied PulsePortraiture based wide-band timing analysis while correcting for the significant evolution of the pulsar profile with frequency. Implementation of PulsePortraiture based wide-band timing method for the GMRT discovered MSPs to probe the DM variations resulted in a DM precision of \$10\^\{-4\}\textbackslash,pc\textasciitilde cm\^\{-3\}\$. In general, we achieve better DM and timing precision from wide-band timing compared to the narrow-band timing with matching temporal variations of DMs. This wide-band timing study of newly discovered MSPs over a frequency range of 300 to 1460 MHz, highlights the effectiveness of profile-modeling at low frequencies and probes the potential of using them in pulsar timing array.},

A total of 25 glitches have been detected in 10 pulsars during the course of the programme, which has monitored 2500 years of pulsar rotation. We present an analysis of these glitches together with their subsequent relaxations. The same analysis has been applied to seven glitches detected by other observing programmes in five other pulsars. Except in the youngest pulsars, the main effect of a glitch is a change in rotation rate, of which only a small fraction is recovered in the subsequent relaxation. In several pulsars, these relaxations are found to consist of a single exponential-like decay, with time-constant of order 100 d, together with a longer term recovery. Consequently, all glitches are analysed as a combination of step changes in the rotation rate and its first two derivatives, and transients that decay exponentially. The longer term relaxation in slow-down rate that is seen in many glitches can be interpreted as either a linear decay in frequency derivative or an exponential decay with time-constant {$\lessequivlnt$} 1000 d.},

  abstract = {Searching for periodic non-accelerated signals in the presence of ideal white noise using the fully phase-coherent fast-folding algorithm (FFA) is theoretically established as a more sensitive search method than the fast Fourier transform (FFT) search with incoherent harmonic summing. In this paper, we present a comparison of the performance of an FFA search implementation using RIPTIDE and an FFT search implementation using PRESTO, over a range of signal parameters with white noise and with real telescope noise from the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) High Resolution Southern Sky (GHRSS) survey with the upgraded GMRT (uGMRT). We find that the FFA search with appropriate de-reddening of the time series performs better than the FFT search with spectral whitening for long-period pulsars under real GHRSS noise conditions. We describe an FFA-search pipeline implemented for the GHRSS survey looking for pulsars over a period of 0.1\textendash 100 s and up to a dispersion measure of 500 pc cm-3. We processed GHRSS survey data covering {$\sim$}1500 deg2 of the sky with this pipeline. We re-detected 43 known pulsars with a better signal-to-noise ratio in the FFA search than in the FFT search. We also report the discovery of two new pulsars, including a long-period pulsar with a short duty cycle, using this FFA-search pipeline. A population of long-period pulsars with periods of several seconds or higher could help constrain the pulsar death line.},

  abstract = {The fast Fourier transform (FFT) based periodicity search methods provide an efficient way to search for millisecond and binary pulsars but encounter significant sensitivity degradation while searching for long period and short duty cycle pulsars. An alternative to FFT-based search methods called the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA) search, provides superior sensitivity to search for signals with long periods and short duty cycles. In the GMRT High Resolution Southern Sky (GHRSS) survey, we are using an FFA-based pipeline to search for isolated pulsars in a period range of 100 ms to 100 s. We have processed 2800 degree\$\^2\$ of the sky coverage away from the Galactic plane and discovered 6 new pulsars. Here, we report the discovery of 4 of these pulsars with the FFA search pipeline. This includes a narrow duty cycle pulsar, J1936\$-\$30, which shows nulling behavior with an extreme nulling fraction of \$\textbackslash sim 90\textbackslash\%\$. Two of the GHRSS discoveries from the FFA search lie in narrow duty cycle ranges beyond the limit of the existing population. The implementation of FFA search in the GHRSS survey and other pulsar surveys is expected to recover the missing population of long period and short duty cycle pulsars.},

PSR J1946+2052 is a 17 ms pulsar in a 1.88 hr, eccentric (e = 0.06) orbit with a {$\greaterequivlnt$}1.2 M{$\odot$} companion. We have used the Jansky Very Large Array to localize PSR J1946+2052 to a precision of 0.{${''}$}09 using a new phase binning mode. We have searched multiwavelength catalogs for coincident sources but did not find any counterparts. The improved position enabled a measurement of the spin period derivative of the pulsar (); the small inferred magnetic field strength at the surface (BS = 4 \texttimes{} 109 G) indicates that this pulsar has been recycled. This and the orbital eccentricity lead to the conclusion that PSR J1946+2052 is in a DNS system. Among all known radio pulsars in DNS systems, PSR J1946+2052 has the shortest orbital period and the shortest estimated merger timescale, 46 Myr; at that time it will display the largest spin effects on gravitational-wave waveforms of any such system discovered to date. We have measured the advance of periastron passage for this system, , implying a total system mass of only 2.50 {$\pm$} 0.04 M{$\odot$}, so it is among the lowest-mass DNS systems. This total mass measurement combined with the minimum companion mass constrains the pulsar mass to {$\lessequivlnt$}1.3 M{$\odot$}.},

PSR J0250+5854 was discovered by the LOFAR Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS), an all-Northern-sky survey for pulsars and fast transients at a central observing frequency of 135 MHz. We subsequently detected pulsations from the pulsar in the interferometric images of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, allowing for sub-arcsecond localization. This, along with a pre-discovery detection 2 years prior, allowed us to measure the spin-period derivative to be \$\textbackslash dot\{P\}=2.7 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-14\}\$ s s\$\^\{-1\}\$. The observed spin period derivative of PSR J0250+5854 indicates a surface magnetic field strength, characteristic age and spin-down luminosity of \$2.6 \textbackslash times 10\^\{13\}\$G, \$13.7\$ Myr and \$8.2 \textbackslash times 10\^\{28\}\$ erg s\$\^\{-1\}\$ respectively, for a dipolar magnetic field configuration. This also places the pulsar beyond the conventional pulsar death line, where radio emission is expected to cease. The spin period of PSR J0250+5854 is similar to those of the high-energy-emitting magnetars and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs). However, the pulsar was not detected by the Swift/XRT in the energy band of 0.3-10 keV, placing a bolometric luminosity limit of \$1.5 \textbackslash times 10\^\{32\}\$ erg s\$\^\{-1\}\$ for an assumed \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm H\}=1.35\textbackslash times10\^\{21\}\$ cm\$\^\{-2\}\$ and a temperature of 85 eV (typical of XDINSs). We discuss the implications of the discovery for models of the pulsar death line as well as the prospect of finding more similarly long-period pulsars, including the advantages provided by LOTAAS for this.},

  abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond radio pulses originating from powerful enigmatic sources at extragalactic distances. Neutron stars with large magnetic fields (magnetars) have been considered as the sources powering the FRBs, but the connection requires further substantiation. Here we report the detection by the AGILE satellite on 28 April 2020 of an X-ray burst in temporal coincidence with a bright FRB-like radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. The burst observed in the hard X-ray band (18\textendash 60\,keV) lasted about 0.5\,s, it is spectrally cut off above 80\,keV and implies an isotropically emitted energy of about 1040\,erg. This event demonstrates that a magnetar can produce X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB-like radio bursts. It also suggests that FRBs associated with magnetars can emit X-ray bursts. We discuss SGR 1935+2154 in the context of FRBs with low\textendash intermediate radio energies in the range 1038\textendash 1040\,erg. Magnetars with magnetic fields B\,{$\approx$}\,1015\,G may power these FRBs, and new data on the search for X-ray emission from FRBs are presented. We constrain the bursting X-ray energy of the nearby FRB 180916 to be less than 1046\,erg, smaller than that observed in giant flares from Galactic magnetars.},

The results indicate that at the present level of precision, the PSR 1913 + 16 can be modeled dynamically as a pair of orbiting point masses. Five Keplerian and five post-Keplerian orbital parameters are therefore mostly determined with remarkably high precision. The masses of the pulsar and its companion are determined to be m1 = 1.442 + or - 0.003 and m2 = 1.386 + or - 0.003 times the mass of the sun, respectively, and the orbit is found to be decaying at a rate equal to 1.01 + or - 0.01 times the general relativistic prediction for gravitational damping. The results represent the first experimental tests of gravitation theory not restricted to the weak-field, slow-motion limit in which nonlinearities and radiation effects are negligible. Excellent agreement between observation and theory indicates conclusively that gravitational radiation exists, at the level predicted by general relativity.},

We report on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the counterpart and find that it is an extended (0.{${''}$}6\textendash 0.{${''}$}8) object displaying prominent Balmer and [O iii] emission lines. Based on the spectrum and emission line ratios, we classify the counterpart as a low-metallicity, star-forming, mr{${'}$} = 25.1 AB mag dwarf galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.19273(8), corresponding to a luminosity distance of 972 Mpc. From the angular size, the redshift, and luminosity, we estimate the host galaxy to have a diameter {$\lessequivlnt$}4 kpc and a stellar mass of M* {$\sim$} (4\textendash 7) \texttimes{} 107 M{$\odot$}, assuming a mass-to-light ratio between 2 to 3 M{$\odot$} L{$\odot-$}1. Based on the H{$\alpha$} flux, we estimate the star formation rate of the host to be 0.4 M{$\odot$} yr-1 and a substantial host dispersion measure (DM) depth {$\lessequivlnt$}324 pc cm-3. The net DM contribution of the host galaxy to FRB 121102 is likely to be lower than this value depending on geometrical factors. We show that the persistent radio source at FRB 121102's location reported by Marcote et al. is offset from the galaxy's center of light by {$\sim$}200 mas and the host galaxy does not show optical signatures for AGN activity. If FRB 121102 is typical of the wider FRB population and if future interferometric localizations preferentially find them in dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and prominent emission lines, they would share such a preference with long gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae.},

  abstract = {'Downwards drifting' structures observed in fast radio bursts (FRBs) could naturally arise from a screen occurring after a small initial dispersion measure region. The screen imprints temporally sharp but broadband structure on the pulse that has already been dispersed, and the `structure-maximising' bulk of the dispersion measure is acquired further along the path to observer. If so, scaling of the drift rate of repeating FRBs with frequency suggests that the emission is beamed -- out of our line of sight -- with the circum-burst plasma deflecting the beam towards us. This in turn explains the observed limited, variable bandwidths of bursts despite broadband nature of the underlying emission. We summarise the geometric constraints on this simple model delivering much of the observed FRB spectro-temporal phenomenology, present generic predictions and discuss possible nature of modulation.},

The results highlight the necessity to develop algorithms that are able to identify and remove non-stationary variations from the data before RFI excision and searching is performed in order to limit false-positive detections. The results also show that the spectrum whitening algorithms currently employed, severely affect the efficiency of pulsar search pipelines by reducing their sensitivity to long-period pulsars.}

The determination of the ``Keplerian'' orbital elements plus two relativistic terms completely characterizes the binary system, aside from an unknown rotation about the line of sight, leading to a determination of the masses of the pulsar and its companion: 1.438 {$\pm$} 0.001 M {$\odot$} and 1.390 {$\pm$} 0.001 M {$\odot$}, respectively. In addition, the complete system characterization allows for the creation of relativistic gravitation test by comparing measured and predicted sizes of various relativistic phenomena. We find that the ratio of the observed orbital period decrease caused by gravitational wave damping (corrected by a kinematic term) to the general relativistic prediction is 0.9983 {$\pm$} 0.0016, thereby confirms the existence and strength of gravitational radiation as predicted by general relativity. For the first time in this system, we have also successfully measured the two parameters characterizing the Shapiro gravitational propagation delay, and found that their values are consistent with general relativistic predictions. For the first time in any system, we have also measured the relativistic shape correction to the elliptical orbit, {$\delta$} \texttheta{} , although its intrinsic value is obscured by currently unquantified pulsar emission beam aberration. We have also marginally measured the time derivative of the projected semimajor axis, which, when improved in combination with beam aberration modeling from geodetic precession observations, should ultimately constrain the pulsar's moment of inertia.},

  abstract = {In binary radio pulsars with a main-sequence star companion, the spin-induced quadrupole moment of the companion gives rise to a precession of the binary orbit. As a first approximation one can model the secular evolution caused by this classical spin-orbit coupling by linear-in-time changes of the longitude of periastron and the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit. This simple representation of the precession of the orbit neglects two important aspects of the orbital dynamics of a binary pulsar with an oblate companion. First, the quasiperiodic effects along the orbit, owing to the anisotropic 1/r3 nature of the quadrupole potential. Secondly, the long-term secular evolution of the binary orbit, which leads to an evolution of the longitude of periastron and the projected semi-major axis, which is non-linear in time.In this paper a simple timing formula for binary radio pulsars with a main-sequence star companion is presented which models the short-term secular and most of the short-term periodic effects caused by the classical spin-orbit coupling. I also give extensions of the timing formula that account for long-term secular changes in the binary pulsar motion. It is shown that the short-term periodic effects are important for the timing observations of the binary pulsar PSR B1259-63. The long-term secular effects are likely to become important in the next few years of timing observations of the binary pulsar PSR J0045-7319. They could help to restrict or even determine the moments of inertia of the companion star and thus probe its internal structure.Finally, I reinvestigate the spin-orbit precession of the binary pulsar PSR J0045-7319 since the analysis given in the literature is based on an incorrect expression for the precession of the longitude of periastron. A lower limit of 20\textdegree{} for the inclination of the B star with respect to the orbital plane is derived.}

Using the 305-m Arecibo radiotelescope to make precise timing measurements of pulses from the recently discovered 6.2-ms pulsar PSR1257 +12 (ref. 2), we demonstrate that, rather than being associated with a stellar object, the pulsar is orbited by two or more planet-sized bodies. The planets detected so far have masses of at least 2.8 M{$\oplus$} and 3.4 M{$\oplus$} where M{$\oplus$} is the mass of the Earth. Their respective distances from the pulsar are 0.47 AU and 0.36 AU, and they move in almost circular orbits with periods of 98.2 and 66.6 days. Observations indicate that at least one more planet may be present in this system. The detection of a planetary system around a nearby ({$\sim$}500 pc), old neutron star, together with the recent report on a planetary companion to the pulsar PSR1829\textendash 10 (ref. 3) raises the tantalizing possibility that a non-negligible fraction of neutron stars observable as radio pulsars may be orbited by planet-like bodies.},

Recent observations of a Galactic FRB4\textendash 8 suggest that at least some FRBs originate from magnetars, but the origin of cosmological FRBs is still not settled. Here we report the detection of 1,863 bursts in 82\,h over 54\,days from the repeating source FRB 20201124A (ref.\,9). These observations show irregular short-time variation of the Faraday rotation measure (RM), which scrutinizes the density-weighted line-of-sight magnetic field strength, of individual bursts during the first 36\,days, followed by a constant RM. We detected circular polarization in more than half of the burst sample, including one burst reaching a high fractional circular polarization of 75\%. Oscillations in fractional linear and circular polarizations, as well as polarization angle as a function of wavelength, were detected. All of these features provide evidence for a complicated, dynamically evolving, magnetized immediate environment within about an astronomical unit (au; Earth\textendash Sun distance) of the source. Our optical observations of its Milky-Way-sized, metal-rich host galaxy10\textendash 12 show a barred spiral, with the FRB source residing in a low-stellar-density interarm region at an intermediate galactocentric distance. This environment is inconsistent with a young magnetar engine formed during an extreme explosion of a massive star that resulted in a long gamma-ray burst or superluminous supernova.},

The total gas mass (1.2 \texttimes{} 1011 M{$\odot$}) is dominated by the spherical component, and is consistent with the total baryon mass of the MW expected from the dark matter mass and the cosmic baryon-to-dark-matter ratio.

The Galactic model has an extended thick disk representing the so-called warm interstellar medium, a thin disk representing the Galactic molecular ring, spiral arms based on a recent fit to Galactic H ii regions, a Galactic Center disk, and seven local features including the Gum Nebula, Galactic Loop I, and the Local Bubble. An offset of the Sun from the Galactic plane and a warp of the outer Galactic disk are included in the model. Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189 pulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used for the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the uncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and within 20\% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that 95\% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the TC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all measures. Timescales for pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering are estimated for (real or simulated) Galactic and Magellanic Cloud pulsars and FRBs.},

Popular theories1,2,3,4 of the emission mechanism require continuous electron\textendash positron pair production, with the potential responsible for accelerating the particles being inversely related to the spin period. Pair production will stop when the potential drops below a threshold, so the models predict that radio emission will cease when the period exceeds a value that depends on the magnetic field strength and configuration. Here we show that the pulsar J2144-3933, previously thought to have a period of 2.84\,s, actually has a period of 8.51\,s, which is by far the longest of any known radio pulsar. Moreover, under the usual model assumptions5, based on the neutron-star equations of state, this slowly rotating pulsar should not be emitting a radio beam. Therefore either the model assumptions are wrong, or current theories of radio emission must be revised.},

  abstract = {Astronomical radio signals are subjected to phase dispersion while traveling through the interstellar medium. To optimally detect a short-duration signal within a frequency band, we have to precisely compensate for the unknown pulse dispersion, which is a computationally demanding task. We present the ``fast dispersion measure transform'' algorithm for optimal detection of such signals. Our algorithm has a low theoretical complexity of , where Nf, Nt, and N{$\Delta$} are the numbers of frequency bins, time bins, and dispersion measure bins, respectively. Unlike previously suggested fast algorithms, our algorithm conserves the sensitivity of brute-force dedispersion. Our tests indicate that this algorithm, running on a standard desktop computer and implemented in a high-level programming language, is already faster than the state-of-the-art dedispersion codes running on graphical processing units (GPUs). We also present a variant of the algorithm that can be efficiently implemented on GPUs. The latter algorithm's computation and data-transport requirements are similar to those of a two-dimensional fast Fourier transform, indicating that incoherent dedispersion can now be considered a nonissue while planning future surveys. We further present a fast algorithm for sensitive detection of pulses shorter than the dispersive smearing limits of incoherent dedispersion. In typical cases, this algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than enumerating dispersion measures and coherently dedispersing by convolution. We analyze the computational complexity of pulsed signal searches by radio interferometers. We conclude that, using our suggested algorithms, maximally sensitive blind searches for dispersed pulses are feasible using existing facilities. We provide an implementation of these algorithms in Python and MATLAB.},

Our technique combines neural network detection with dedispersion verification. For the current application, we demonstrate its advantage over a traditional brute-force dedispersion algorithm in terms of higher sensitivity, lower false-positive rates, and faster computational speed.

The number of data points reveals trends in pulse fluence, pulse detection rate, and pulse frequency structure. We introduce a new periodicity search technique, based on the Rayleigh test, to analyze the time of arrivals (TOAs), with which we exclude with 99\% confidence periodicity in TOAs with periods larger than 5.1 times the model-dependent timestamp uncertainty.

The rapid accumulation of the observational data has painted the following sketch about the physical origin of FRBs: They predominantly originate from cosmological distances so that their sources produce the most extreme coherent radio emission in the universe; at least some, probably most, FRBs are repeating sources that do not invoke cataclysmic events; and at least some FRBs are produced by magnetars, neutron stars with the strongest magnetic fields in the universe. Many open questions regarding the physical origin(s) and mechanism(s) of FRBs remain. This article reviews the phenomenology and possible underlying physics of FRBs. Topics include: a summary of the observational data, basic plasma physics, general constraints on FRB models from the data, radiation mechanisms, source and environment models, propagation effects, as well as FRBs as cosmological probes.

The observations were carried out in the band of 1.0 - 1.5 GHz by using the center beam of the L-band 19-beam receiver. We monitored the source in sixteen 1-hour sessions and one 3-hour session spanning 23 days. All the bursts were detected during the first four days. In this first paper of the series, we perform a detailed morphological study of 624 bursts using the 2-dimensional frequency-time ``waterfall'' plots, with a burst (or cluster-burst) defined as an emission episode during which the adjacent emission peaks have a separation shorter than 400 ms. The duration of a burst is therefore always longer than 1 ms, with the longest up to more than 120 ms. The emission spectra of the sub-bursts are typically narrow within the observing band with a characteristic width of \$\textbackslash sim\$277 MHz. The center frequency distribution has a dominant peak at about 1091.9 MHz and a secondary weak peak around 1327.9 MHz. Most bursts show a frequency-downward-drifting pattern. Based on the drifting patterns, we classify the bursts into five main categories: downward drifting (263) bursts, upward drifting (3) bursts, complex (203), no drifting (35) bursts, and no evidence for drifting (121) bursts. Subtypes are introduced based on the emission frequency range in the band (low, middle, high and wide) as well as the number of components in one burst (1, 2, or multiple). We measured a varying scintillation bandwidth from about 0.5 MHz at 1.0 GHz to 1.4 MHz at 1.5 GHz with a spectral index of 3.0.},

  abstract = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most mysterious astronomical transients. Observationally, they can be classified into repeaters and apparently non-repeaters. However, due to the lack of continuous observations, some apparently repeaters may have been incorrectly recognized as non-repeaters. In a series of two papers, we intend to solve such problem with machine learning. In this second paper of the series, we focus on an array of unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply multiple unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the first CHIME/FRB catalog to learn their features and classify FRBs into different clusters without any premise about the FRBs being repeaters or non-repeaters. These clusters reveal the differences between repeaters and non-repeaters. Then, by comparing with the identities of the FRBs in the observed classes, we evaluate the performance of various algorithms and analyze the physical meaning behind the results. Finally, we recommend a list of most credible repeater candidates as targets for future observing campaigns to search for repeated bursts in combination of the results presented in Paper I using supervised machine learning methods.},
